Vince Gilligan is in the library at Variety ’s New York office, surrounded by tens of thousands of newspaper and magazine archives dating back to 1905. He’s reading from a thick, brown book stamped JANUARY 2008, wherein lies this publication’s first review of “Breaking Bad.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“Vince Gilligan brings a quirky sensibility to the pilot, and the show grows increasingly rich and absorbing in the second and third hours,” he recites. “Whether ‘Breaking Bad’ can ignite to become more than TV’s version of a little-seen indie film, however, could be an elusive formula.” Popular on Variety
Hovering over his shoulder, Rhea Seehorn bursts into laughter.
Not only did “Breaking Bad” earn four more seasons that cemented it as one of the greatest TV shows of all time , it also spawned the spinoff “Better Call Saul,” centering the original series’ comic relief character in a drama that, astonishingly, managed to build up to the chair-gripping heights of its predecessor. Together, these shows made Gilligan into the rare TV creator who can still demand blank-check trust from Hollywood. He cashed in on that trust with “Pluribus,” his ambitious, clearly high-budget, eagerly awaited new series. It arrived Nov. 7 on Apple TV with two episodes.
Seehorn, who played Kim Wexler on six seasons of “Better Call Saul,” is the star of “Pluribus,” an original sci-fi drama that has nothing to do with courtrooms or cartels, but is set in Gilligan’s familiar Albuquerque. The run-up to “Pluribus” has been highly secretive, with cryptic promotional materials and a long list of embargoed spoilers from Apple. Its comically vague logline reads: “The most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness.”
Now that the first two episodes are out, here is the basic rundown: A group of space watchers discover an alien signal 600 lightyears away that contains a recipe for an RNA sequence, prompting months of animal testing by researchers in hazmat suits. An accidental lab leak infects the scientists with a virus that compels them to kiss each other and contaminate petri dishes with saliva until the whole world is possessed in what’s referred to as “The Joining.” Well, all but 12 people who are mysteriously immune to this sickness, including Seehorn’s curmudgeonly, self-hating romantasy author Carol Sturka.
Carol is at a bar when the rest of the population, including her wife Helen, begins to twitch unconsciously. In a panic, she drives Helen to the hospital while the city goes up in flames, but it’s too late. Everyone has suddenly been reanimated into friendly zombies. “We just want to help, Carol,” the doctors and patients say in unison — and they mean it. Later, a White House official, speaking for “every person on Earth,” assures Carol through the television that this is not an alien invasion. It’s not exactly a virus, either, but rather “a psychic glue capable of binding us all together.” How does it all work? “We don’t know, exactly,” he says with a smile. “It just does.”
While the pandemic-esque opening of the show might give you trauma flashbacks to “Tiger King” and drive-by birthday parties, Gilligan says he came up with the idea for “Pluribus” years before COVID. In the throes of writing “Better Call Saul,” he would take 90-minute lunch breaks and meander around Toluca Lake, taking a mental vacation from the world of Saul Goodman.
“I started pondering this idea almost 10 years ago. It was originally about a guy, because I tend to think that way,” says Gilligan, who is dressed in a checkered blazer and clean shaven for the first time in years. He imagined a show that started with an Earth-shattering event, and in the aftermath, the entire population suddenly became “unfailingly nice” to the protagonist, “so much so that they basically give their lives for this guy.”
Eventually, as he continued thinking about “Pluribus” while barrelling toward the end of “Better Call Saul,” something clicked: the main role was Seehorn’s. He started writing the character specifically for her without telling her. “You just can’t take your eyes off her,” Gilligan says. “She’s got a wonderful charisma. And she can do anything — make you laugh, make you cry.” It’s no wonder Gilligan initially wrote Kim Wexler as a love interest who might not make it to Season 2 of “Saul,” until “Rhea made herself indispensable.” (She would also go on to earn two Emmy nominations for her performance.)
In early 2022, as they were wrapping production on the final season of “Saul,” Gilligan told Seehorn he wrote something for her, but wasn’t ready to give her the script — or any details about it at all. “Whatever it is, yes, I want to do it,” Seehorn told him. Meanwhile, Gilligan was so terrified that she would be enticed by another project that he asked executive producer Melissa Bernstein to flag him if she heard anything about Seehorn taking another job.
A few months later, the whole gang shuttled to the Albuquerque Convention Center as the city unveiled statues of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. Staring up at the iconic drug slingers immortalized in bronze, just two weeks before the “Saul” series finale would air, Seehorn began thinking about Gilligan’s mysterious script.
“I didn’t want to bring it up and put him in a corner, but every day I was going, ‘Is this real?’” she recalls. As they walked back to the car, Gilligan pulled her aside and, as if reading her mind, said, “I didn’t forget about the script.”
He finally sent it when Seehorn was on vacation with her family, at an adult camp in New Hampshire with spotty cell service. “You had to crouch in the corner of a room or climb a tree and get an antenna with oil on it to get internet,” Seehorn says with a laugh. She was such a “nervous wreck” that she made her husband read it first, studying his face as he scrolled through the pages.
Sitting here today, Seehorn can’t quite describe why she was anxious. Gilligan has a suggestion: “What if it sucks?” Seehorn shoots him down with an “oh please” hand gesture. “I knew it was going to be great,” she says, spinning a Starbucks cup on the table. “It’s waiting for this thing you could not be more excited to start, but now it’s real.”
Aside from co-creating the short-lived CBS dramedy “Battle Creek” in 2015, Gilligan had not ventured outside of his meth-and-death-ridden vision of New Mexico since 2008. And when he popped his head back into the Hollywood marketplace, he wasn’t sure if his new wacky, original idea would be welcome. “I wouldn’t say there was pressure, but there was a certain level of expectation,” he says. “A certain level of, ‘What’s next in the “Breaking Bad” world?’”
“We live in a world of IP, where the safest thing to do is reboot something that has an audience. I wanted to prove to myself I wasn’t a one-trick pony,” Gilligan says. “It’s harder than it’s ever been to get something made that’s not based on a previous movie or comic book or video game. Every generation deserves its own stories, instead of just the stories of their grandparents.”
Still, “Pluribus” ignited the first bidding war of Gilligan’s career, with several studios vying for the opportunity to bring his grinning apocalypse to life. It was a flattering, if not slightly uncomfortable affair for Gilligan. “I enjoyed that experience very much, but then in a weird way I didn’t,” he says. “It was great to be wanted, but I met with all these nice folks and I had to say no to some of them, and that was not enjoyable.” (They don’t call Gilligan the nicest showrunner in Hollywood for nothing.)
He went with Apple TV because they promised him the “two gifts of trust and time.” It didn’t hurt that the heads of the studio, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, were the same executives who greenlit “Breaking Bad” at Sony 18 years ago.
After spending a decade and a half in the brains of a meth kingpin and a slimeball attorney, Gilligan wanted his next protagonist to be a force for good. “I wrote on ‘The X Files’ for seven years, and I started to take for granted the idea of heroes. Mulder and Scully were heroic. They were trying to save the world. At a certain point, you do umpteen million episodes of that, and you think, ‘I’m ready for an antihero or a bad guy,’” Gilligan says. (He famously pitched “Breaking Bad” as the story of a man who transforms himself from Mr. Chips to Scarface.) “But at this point in humanity and in world history, I think we need more good guys again. We need more heroes.”
Not that Carol is a traditional TV hero, of course. As Seehorn puts it, she’s an “emotional hot mess” who “can’t control her anger”; Gilligan uses the words “reluctant” and “inept.” “The folks who rise to the occasion, despite the fact that they’re scared and lonely and sad and would rather have someone else take this mantle from them,” he adds, “those are the interesting characters to me.”
By the end of the first episode of “Pluribus,” it becomes clear that the “pluribus,” so to speak, wish to share their cult-like nirvana with the remaining 12 people on Earth. But for whatever reason, they cannot or will not force Carol to do anything against her will. In Episode 2, they send a butler-like representative, Zosia (Karolina Wydra), to help Carol with anything she might need, and to spit out press release-like explanations for why her wife is dead and individuality is all but gone. The pluribus share a neural network that has absorbed all human knowledge, which includes personal details about Carol’s life. They speak using the “royal we” and seem to be incapable of lying, as Zosia admits they are “months away” from figuring out how to recruit Carol into the collective consciousness.
Carol’s first big request is to meet with the handful of English-speaking survivors. She expects to form a coalition against the hive, but her fellow human beings are either delusional — one woman refuses to accept that her child is no longer her child but rather a mouthpiece for billions — or comfortable with their new reality. One man, who has claimed Air Force One as his private jet and surrounded himself with cheetah-print wearing supermodels, points out that in the New World, there is no crime and no racism. He asks Carol: “Why does the world need saving?”
“Carol is running around saying, ‘Are you guys aware the barn is on fire?’ and everyone’s like, ‘Can you just calm down and get a drink?’” Seehorn says. And so, with Carol intent on restoring what once was, the fate of mankind rests in the hands of someone who doesn’t seem to like people all that much.
Might the show — with its army of all-knowing, obsequious entities consuming humanity — be a metaphor for the dangers of artificial intelligence?
With a half-amused shrug, Gilligan says he was not thinking about AI when he conceived of “Pluribus,” and he wrote it before the rise of large language models like ChatGPT. “One thing I did wrong while doing press for ‘Breaking Bad’ was tell people, ‘This is what this meant! This meant that!’” He remembers conversations with journalists and fans in which he drilled down his belief that his protagonist, Walter White, was, in fact, a villain. “I look back, and it was so tiresome,” Gilligan says. “Whatever people want to take away from this show is 100% up to them.”
Gilligan recalls writing for “Robbery Homicide Division” in 2002 and asking Michael Mann, an executive producer on the CBS procedural, about the theme of his episode. “He looked at me for a minute, not in an unkind way, and was just puzzled,” Gilligan says. Mann responded to him: “Just tell a good story, let the audience figure out the theme. That’s their job.”
Regardless of whether his own feelings seeped into the show, Gilligan has been a vocal skeptic of artificial intelligence. Tucked away in the “Pluribus” credits, it reads, “This show was made by humans.” It’s an important reminder as Big Tech continues to infiltrate Hollywood, and the trillion-dollar companies behind shows like “Pluribus” are also driving the future of AI.
“I hate AI,” Gilligan says with a chuckle. “AI is the world’s most expensive and energy-intensive plagiarism machine. I think there’s a very high possibility that this is all a bunch of horseshit. It’s basically a bunch of centibillionaires whose greatest life goal is to become the world’s first trillionaires. I think they’re selling a bag of vapor.”
Gilligan isn’t afraid of artificial intelligence trouncing on the work of true artists — “My toaster oven isn’t suddenly Thomas Keller because it heats up a delicious pizza for me” — but his sci-fi brain buzzes at the looming threat of “the singularity,” or when AI develops “a true sentience that has its own soul, and therefore its own identity.”
“If they ever achieve that, then the whole discussion of slavery has to come back into the forefront of the conversation,” Gilligan says. “These trillionaires are going to want to make money on this thing that is now conscious. Is it then a slave? At that point, it is a truly sentient being, and these Silicon Valley assholes are going to monetize this against its own will, right?”
He pauses, and then remembers why we started talking about AI in the first place. “ That’s the story I would write,” he says. “But that’s been done to death.”
Closer to home for Seehorn is the recent media flurry around an AI “actress,” Tilly Norwood, supposedly soliciting talent agencies. “I’m fine going on the record that I don’t think any agencies should represent that AI actress,” Seehorn says. “Shame on them!” (Many of the major agencies and guilds in Hollywood have since spoken out against the creation.)
Meanwhile, video-generating software like OpenAI’s Sora showcase the inevitability that AI content will funnel into the mainstream. The question Gilligan has for audiences is: “Do you want to be fed a diet of crap? Is there enough calories in a diet of crap to keep you alive? The answer is yeah, probably. You could eat it.”
He goes on, about how AI-generated content is “like a cow chewing its cud — an endlessly regurgitated loop of nonsense,” and how the U.S. will fail to regulate the technology because of an arms race with China. He works himself up until he’s laughing again, proclaiming: “Thank you, Silicon Valley! Yet again, you’ve fucked up the world.”
He sounds like Carol Sturka, screaming about the barn on fire, before Seehorn offers a glimmer of optimism. Sure, you can prompt an AI to paint you a Picasso, but “even if a computer could make you think there was impasto brushwork there, the reason the painting is moving is because of the human experience that went into transferring that art onto the canvas,” she says. “That matters to me. I think it matters to most people.”
Apple gave “Pluribus” a two-season order, and Gilligan says he sees the series going beyond that. “I think we have a pretty good idea of where it should end,” he says, but that doesn’t mean he’ll stick to it. “One of the most important things I can do in the writers’ room is not be too precious about the ideas. If we come up with a better way to end this thing, we will.”
Of course, nothing is promised in today’s turbulent TV ecosystem, and there’s a chance “Pluribus” could turn out to be an expensive experiment that never quite catches on. Then again, given his track record, it’s more likely Gilligan and Seehorn will look back at this section of the archives two decades from now and share another laugh.

Discovery","David Ellison isn’t afraid to get in the ring.
As the Paramount chief builds a Hollywood juggernaut that could soon swallow Warner Bros. Discovery whole, a different type of construction is taking place 3,000 miles away: Sources say that President Donald Trump has greenlit plans to host one of the first UFC fights under Paramount’s $7.7 billion deal with the MMA league on the lawn of the White House . Dignitaries from around the world will attend a dinner and then head to the Octagon, the eight-sided ring where the main event will play out. Trump and UFC CEO Dana White are spearheading the telecast. The discussed date is June 14, 2026 — which coincides with Trump’s 80th birthday.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly says the fight will be “a spectacular event” that will “celebrate the 250th anniversary of our great country.” Popular on Variety
While the spectacle might sound like a discarded scene from the 2006 dystopian comedy “Idiocracy,” it provides a glimpse into Ellison’s rising empire, one that skews alpha male and that some fear will entwine the studio’s content more closely with MAGA messaging. In rapid-fire fashion, the 42-year-old Ellison has become show business’ ultimate disruptor. The industry’s first millennial mogul wants to change the DNA of Hollywood while building a new type of entertainment leviathan out of the husk of a once-legendary film and television studio. And Paramount, which declined to comment, is just the beginning.
“We’re going after Warners,” Ellison told confidants even before the Paramount deal got the Trump administration’s approval. “I want to be in the top three, not the bottom three.”
By the accounts of many industry insiders, Ellison has been busy leveraging his family’s extraordinary wealth and access to President Trump to prepare for a buying spree. With the help of his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison (the world’s second-richest person behind Elon Musk), the Silicon Valley scion wants to take on Netflix, Amazon and Apple; in the hypercompetitive Ellison family, there’s no prize for being runner-up. If the Ellisons pull it off, they’ll control a media empire with unprecedented reach and cultural influence.
“It’s the Wild West, and these are the new cowboys,” says producer Jon Peters, who ran Sony Pictures from 1989 to 1991. Peters says he has taken a $400 million-plus stake — roughly 4% — in Paramount since it began trading on the Nasdaq as PSKY. “Things have changed,” Peters adds, “and now we’re moving into the biggest revolution that you and I will ever see in our life, which is AI.”
When Skydance took over Paramount, it pointedly referred to itself as a media and technology company. Ellison has repeatedly said that he wants to “embrace AI,” and in meetings he alludes to having developed revolutionary ways to understand what consumers want by accessing vast troves of data. He’s fond of boasting that Oracle’s technological know-how will transform Paramount+ from a second-rate app to a dominant player with a better user experience. (Where all that data comes from remains a mystery.) Some industry observers are skeptical that it will be enough to compete with Netflix and its mighty algorithm. They also believe that even if traditional studios like Paramount and Warner Bros. combine, Netflix and the other streaming giants are so much better established that it will be nearly impossible to catch up.
“Studios are irrelevant; they’re on the ropes. They’re dinosaurs, and the age of dinosaurs is over,” says Schuyler Moore, a partner at Greenberg Glusker. “Their only move now is to consolidate, but there’s no hope even if they get bigger. They’re too late to the party.”
Not according to David Ellison, who projects an image of Paramount as a land of abundance. He wants “more content, not less,” says one source with direct knowledge of his thinking. The proof is in the mad dash his film chiefs are making to build their slate from its current eight annual releases to 15 by 2026, 17 by 2027 and 18 by 2028. Cindy Holland, who helped Netflix develop its original programming strategy and is now running Paramount’s direct-to-consumer operation, is opening the purse to bring better programming to Paramount+.
Hollywood may be wary of the Ellison family. The WGA called the prospect of Paramount buying Warner Bros. Discovery “a disaster for writers, for consumers, and for competition” and vowed to work with regulators to block the merger. But an industry still reeling from the collapse of Peak TV has been reenergized by the emergence of a new, deep-pocketed buyer. And analysts credit Ellison for embracing an expansive vision.
“They clearly have a long-term point of view,” says Jessica Reif Ehrlich, Bank of America Securities senior media and entertainment analyst. “They have a plan to invest in more compelling content, and they are executing on it.”
Since taking over Paramount, Team Ellison has embraced Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra of “move fast and break things,” spending money freely, like purchasing Bari Weiss’ The Free Press — a fledgling Substack-based news outlet — for $150 million. It has also slashed staff and dispensed with top Paramount executives at a dizzying rate, replacing them with executives with unfashionable — by Hollywood standards — viewpoints, from vocal Israel supporters (CBS News editor-in-chief Weiss) to political conservatives (Paramount co-chair Josh Greenstein), and jumped into business with a new brand of power brokers, namely White. Those who remain have faced pointed questions, often delivered in blunt tones, that betray irritation at how inefficiently the new regime feels the legacy media company had been run.
Taking a page from the MAGA playbook, Ellison doesn’t seem to care about optics. An Oct. 29 round of roughly 1,000 layoffs hit women in high-profile roles hard. Among the 14 reported TV executives who received a pink slip — spanning CBS, BET and MTV — 11 were women. Over at CBS News, some cuts — like Tracy Wholf, a senior producer of climate and environmental coverage — were viewed as Trump-friendly moves. One staffer says that the ax conspicuously fell on those whose reporting featured an anti-Israel bent, including foreign correspondent Debora Patta, who had been covering the war in Gaza for the past three years. A source close to Paramount says the October layoffs were not motivated by MAGA politics or gender.
But Israel is an important issue. Larry Ellison is reportedly a close friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and is a prolific donor to Friends of the IDF. Weiss has been so vocal in her support of the country that she faces frequent death threats. She and her wife, The Free Press co-founder Nellie Bowles, require a detail of five bodyguards that costs the studio $10,000-$15,000 a day. There has also been a noticeable step-up in security measures around the company’s executive leadership (one insider says the entire C-suite has received threats).
Paramount’s leadership has not shied away from making its views on the war in Gaza public. In September, it became the first major studio to denounce a celebrity-driven open letter signed by A-listers like Emma Stone and Javier Bardem that called for a boycott of Israeli film institutions implicated in “genocide and apartheid” against Palestinians. (Warner Bros. followed, but cited legal reasons for its decision.) And sources say Paramount maintains a list of talent it will not work with because they are deemed to be “overtly antisemitic” as well as “xenophobic” and “homophobic.” Whether the boycott signatories are on that list is unclear. [ Update , Nov. 7 : Other sources intimately familiar with Paramount said that while an itemized list does not exist, the management team shares a set of values and has no desire to work with anyone who expresses hate in public and damaging ways].
Around the studio lot and offices, open debate about business strategy, even arguments that can grow heated, are more frequent than under the previous regime. Greenstein, a former top Sony executive enlisted to run the studio with Skydance veteran Dana Goldberg, is said to have a differing professional style from his boss, Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal chief who was installed as Paramount’s president. A person who observed them together compares them to “oil and water.”
Ellison has not been immune to pushback from his staff. Greenstein and Goldberg tried — and failed — to dissuade their boss from giving Will Smith and his company Westbrook an overall deal with the studio, arguing that the Oscar-slap controversy and a dodgy box office track record would result in more headaches than hits.
Despite the disagreements over strategy, there is a shared sense of urgency around the need to fundamentally transform Paramount, as the new executive leadership recognizes it must move fast to pull off its grand plans. In addition to signing talent deals with Smith and Matt and Ross Duffer, the brothers behind Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” the team is trying to assemble a slate of films that can attract audiences to theaters at a time when the box office is in a slump. Ellison personally courted “A Complete Unknown”’s James Mangold and is shelling out up to $100 million to produce “High Side,” a motocross thriller that will be the director’s next film with Timothée Chalamet. Insiders at Paramount insist that the film will cost less and no official budget has been set.
Some long-gestating productions, such as the Miles Teller sports drama “Winter Games,” have been put into turnaround, while there has also been a focus on reinvigorating certain franchises. The hope is to have a fresh “Star Trek” movie, though the studio has moved on from the idea of bringing back Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and the rest of the ensemble from the J.J. Abrams reboot. It is also working on sequels to “Top Gun” and “Days of Thunder,” with the films’ star, Tom Cruise, recently visiting the Paramount lot to congratulate the Skydance team on its takeover and to discuss a return to those franchises and other possible collaborations. (Some of the films that Paramount is greenlighting, including a movie about a cowboy and his dog searching for his missing daughter that’s been likened to a Western version of “Taken,” were described as “America-centric” and geared toward the middle of the country.)
Not everything has gone smoothly. The Skydance team was shocked when Taylor Sheridan, the creator of many of Paramount+’s biggest franchises, such as “Yellowstone” and “Tulsa King,” defected for a lucrative deal with NBCUniversal. Ellison had spent time cultivating Sheridan, flying down to Texas with Shell, Greenstein and Goldberg, where the new mogul suggested possible shows that could be additions to the Sheridan-verse. The overtures backfired, with Sheridan preferring a less corporate approach. Although Sheridan, whose content plays big in red state America and presumably would have fit in seamlessly with the new mentality, has three years remaining on his deal with Paramount, his exit leaves a big hole.
“It’s a huge loss for them,” says Ehrlich. “If you look at Paramount+, [Sheridan] is responsible for 90% of their successful programming.”
Before he leaves, though, Sheridan will help Paramount deliver on one of Ellison’s biggest priorities; he’s been tapped to write the screenplay for “Call of Duty,” an adaptation of the popular video game franchise that encapsulates the kind of patriotic, flag-waving films that the studio wants to make. Directing the film is Peter Berg, who recently said on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” “I think Trump’s doing some great things” — the type of sentiment that could land talent on a blacklist anywhere but Paramount.
In person, Ellison has an “aw-shucks” demeanor and strikes people who have worked with him as wonky, unfailingly polite and a little shy. But since he took the reins at Paramount, he’s instilled a very different climate from the left-leaning one found at most major studios. Prior to the merger, television sets in executive offices were usually turned to CNBC or CNN. Now, some employees have conspicuously changed the channel to Fox News, according to one executive. Another source, however, disputes this and says most of the offices are still being renovated and have television sets that have yet to be mounted or plugged in. Over on the Melrose lot, Greenstein boasts about hitting the shooting range, while at CBS News’ midtown headquarters, the race and culture unit — formed in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder in 2020 — has been dissolved.
There’s a reason for the cultural shift. After all, Larry Ellison’s loyalty to the president has already paid off. The Trump administration greenlit the Paramount Skydance merger, despite antitrust concerns, and allowed the Oracle co-founder to be part of a consortium to acquire TikTok that also includes conservative-leaning Lachlan Murdoch. Now, Ellison advisers are privately crowing that they are the only viable choice to buy Warner Bros. Discovery given that rivals would face obstacles from U.S. regulators, whereas the Ellisons could get the deal done. Trump already has given Weiss a vote of confidence, saying that CBS News has “great potential” and that he expects coverage to be “fairer” now. For his part, Trump told a press gaggle aboard Air Force One in mid-October that Larry and David Ellison “are friends of mine. They’re big supporters of mine.” Then, with a line that could have been lifted from “The Godfather,” the president added, “And they’ll do the right thing.”
Most of Hollywood is buzzing about what the U.S. cultural landscape might look like if the Ellisons succeed in acquiring CNN — and the rest of Warner Bros. Discovery. The Ellisons have made two offers for Warner Bros. Discovery after floating a trial balloon in September about its plan to bid, which had the effect of putting the company in play. Netflix is reportedly considering making its own offer, though some industry sources believe the streamer is mostly trying to drive up the price Paramount Skydance will need to pay.
The expectation is that the Ellisons will prevail, and when they do, they’ll have access to a far richer and deeper library than the one they control at Paramount. The Burbank studio boasts DC Studios and its arsenal of superheroes, certain rights to “Harry Potter” and HBO, still the preeminent tastemaker in the television world.
However, all that premium content might not be enough to resolve the fundamental problems with the business models of legacy media companies like Paramount — namely, that linear broadcast and cable channels still account for as much as 80% of Paramount’s annual revenues. And television is losing audience rapidly to streamers. That’s created the conditions in which two of the five remaining traditional studios feel the pressure to merge — to get bigger in order to withstand the headwinds.
“Despite the volatility of the movie industry, for 100 years it was one of the most stable industries in the history of American business,” says Snap chairman and former Sony Pictures Entertainment chief Michael Lynton. “The same six players were there from the very outset, with the possible exception of RKO. And those same players stayed there without consolidation. It was almost impossible to have a new entrant because you needed a big library and distribution, and obviously that took years and years to create. Then technology companies came in. They became incredibly disruptive. That’s in large part the reason why you’re seeing what you’re seeing happening now [with the Ellisons].”
The Ellisons should be careful what they wish for; most media mergers ultimately aren’t worth the time and effort. For every smart acquisition, like Disney’s purchase of Marvel, there’s a corporate catastrophe on the scale of AOL Time Warner. Synergies often fail to materialize, and it takes upwards of three years for companies to integrate. David Ellison is aware of that tangled history, telling acquaintances that he doesn’t want any purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery to mirror Disney’s $71.3 billion deal for much of 21st Century Fox — a pact that is now widely considered to have been too costly.
“Almost every major media deal has been a disaster,” says Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst with TD Cowen. “People always convince themselves that even though they’ve all blown up in the past, this time it will work for them, and they’re almost always wrong.”
While David Ellison is the frontman in the family’s Hollywood forays, there is a sense that he is moving in lockstep with his father, who brings a mentality far different from what has reigned in Hollywood for more than a century — that the mogul with the most content wins. Instead, he follows a different guiding principle.
“Larry Ellison has a fundamental belief that the guy with the most data wins,” says Derek Reisfield, the first president of CBS New Media (now CBS Interactive) and co-founder of MarketWatch. “That’s been his mantra at Oracle. That’s what is going on with the Warner Bros. Discovery bid. And Larry wants to salt the earth so the competitors can’t come back. By buying all this now and doing it quickly when he has an advantage, it’s sort of game over for everybody else.”
Among Paramount’s competitors, Netflix is said to be most shaken by Ellison’s arrival — and his seemingly endless supply of capital. (A spokesperson for Netflix denies that characterization.) Paramount’s resurgence comes as Netflix is being targeted by the MAGA faithful with calls for consumers to cancel their subscriptions due to what they label as “woke” content aimed at kids. And Wall Street seems to have its concerns, handing Netflix, on Oct. 22, its single worst day since 2022.
Whether or not the Ellisons capture the Warners flag, they face morale problems. The first round of layoffs cut deep enough. But another 1,000 pink slips are expected globally in the second round. The prospect of full AI integration spells doom for many at a time when spirits are already low. Some say they could overlook the studio’s Trumpian turn, which could have reverberations right down to the news division. But they are incensed by the casual bloodletting of Oct. 29, carried out in a drip-drip throughout the day, stoking greater anxiety.
“I’ve lost a lot of friends. A lot of really great writers and a lot of really great journalists have lost their jobs to pay for Bari’s six bodyguards and $150 million deal,” says a CBS News staffer. “And I think that’s bullshit.”
Another Paramount executive was shocked by how coldly the company dispensed with people who had worked there for decades.
“They didn’t show a lot of respect,” the exec says. “I’ve been through other mergers, and there’s no other word to describe this one than merciless. It’s a new way of doing business.”

But attendees at the Los Angeles premiere event on Nov. 6 for the fifth and final season of Netflix’s “ Stranger Things ” might not have noticed.
Harbour was all smiles on the red carpet, particularly as he playfully hugged co-star Millie Bobby Brown , and they took selfies with fans. The two arrived at the event together, and even traded compliments in interviews on the carpet: Brown told “Entertainment Tonight” that she “obviously had a really special bond with David because we have a father-daughter relationship, and we do every scene together… It’s been so special to have him along the journey for me.” When Harbour spoke with ET, the only outlet he granted an interview , he said of Brown: “I adore her, and I’ve been proud to watch all of them grow up and become such great artists… this particular project is so special, and we’ve gotten to know each other so deeply.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
If the two seemed overly chummy on Thursday, perhaps that was the point: The premiere event came just days after the U.K.’s Daily Mail Nov. 1 report that Brown had filed a complaint of bullying and harassment against Harbour prior to the start of production of Season 5. Neither star commented on the story, and Harbour limited his interactions with the press at the premiere. Popular on Variety
The news of Brown’s complaint against Harbour has threatened to overshadow coverage of the final season of “Stranger Things.” But insiders say that even before the recent news, Harbour wasn’t expected to take part in press junkets for the show due to his busy filming schedule. (His upcoming projects next year include HBO’s “DTF St. Louis” — with Jason Bateman and Linda Cardellini — and Marvel’s “Avengers: Doomsday,” opening December 2026.)
PR experts suggested to Variety that the red carpet choreography — as well as the full cast’s appearance together on stage at the TCL Chinese Theater prior to screening Episode 1 — was meant to send a message that the cast is united, and that the show is bigger than any one person. “The goal in these situations is to make it no worse ,” one crisis PR exec said.
Instead, Netflix leaned into the imagery of Harbour and Brown being playful on the carpet , posting a video of the two as they greeted fans. Brown’s fashion brand, Florence by Mills, liked the video and posted a heart emoji, and many of the fan comments on the post suggested that they thought the reports of drama between the two stars was much ado about nothing. Photos taken inside the party also show the two being chummy.
Sources with knowledge of the situation have confirmed to Variety that there was an investigation into Brown’s complaint, and that it was resolved. As father and daughter on the show, as well as comrades in arms, Brown and Harbour share multiple scenes in Season 5 of “Stranger Things,” including a scene observed by a reporter for Variety during a day-long visit to the set in July 2024 .
Representatives for Brown, Harbour and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment. On the carpet, the show’s creative leaders — creators Matt and Ross Duffer, and executive producer Shawn Levy — were asked about the complaint directly by the Hollywood Reporter ; while they declined to speak about the actors by name, they all spoke about the importance of ensuring their cast feels safe within the “family” atmosphere of the show.
“I’ve read a bunch of stories and they range from wildly inaccurate to…there’s so much noise around it,” Levy told the outlet. “But the truth is that we view this crew and this cast as family, and so we treat each other with respect, and that’s always been bedrock.” Said Ross Duffer: “We’ve been doing this for 10 years with this cast, and at this point they’re family and we deeply care about them. So, you know, nothing matters more than just having a set where everyone feels safe and happy.”
In the first four seasons of “Stranger Things,” Brown’s character, Eleven (introduced in Season 1 as a quiet, pre-teen girl with extraordinary telekinetic abilities), and Harbour’s character, Hopper (introduced as the burnout chief of police of Hawkins, Indiana), form a surrogate father-daughter bond. In Seasons 2 and 3, Eleven and Hopper experience some friction due to Hopper’s overprotective concern for Eleven’s safety; by Season 4, the characters operate in totally separate storylines and don’t share a scene until the last minutes of the season finale.
The Daily Mail report was sourced to “a friend” of Harbour’s ex-wife Lily Allen. That’s of note because the story of Brown’s complaint broke amid a flurry of attention surrounding Harbour’s divorce from singer-songwriter Allen, whose new album, “West End Girl,” goes into extensive detail about Harbour’s alleged infidelity, as in the song “Pussy Palace.” In his review in Variety , Chris Willman said the album “is a divorce record with a capital D,” and that Allen and Harbour split up “after five years of marriage that apparently started as a fairy-tale romance for her and ended in the devastation strewn throughout every track on the album.”

SPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for the season finale of “The Celebrity Traitors U.K.,” now streaming on BBC iPlayer.
It is rare for the most popular show on television to be one of the best. It is rarer for that television show to become such a public spectacle that screenings of its finale fill out bars and clubs across the country. And it is even rarer for the tensions during those screenings, which you could cut with a knife, to be caused by the comedian Alan Carr .

Yet “The Celebrity Traitors U.K.” did just that. The BBC’s first season of a celebrity version of the game — an elaborate, unpredictable internationally-franchised whodunnit — not only matched expectations. It exceeded them. Popular on Variety
Celebrity formats are usually there to extend the ongoing popularity of an existing show, rather than necessarily add to it. The reason why it worked here was that the celebrities were clearly fans of the show and had their own strategy to begin with. “Celebrity Traitors,” made by reality television powerhouse Studio Lambert, didn’t buckle by adjusting the format to cater for them either, resulting in great gameplay but also surreal moments, such as the first episode where the celebrities were digging their own graves with great enthusiasm.
If you’re reading this piece from the U.S., you might be wondering why there’s been such a fuss over the British version when the U.S. “Traitors” has had celebrities from the very beginning. It’s simple: in the U.K., none of the celebrities had become famous from appearing in other reality shows. There were no exaggerated personas or people trying to hog the cameras on the roundtables.
And whilst some names like Sir Stephen Fry were shielded from early banishment or murder because of their celebrity status, resulting in the premature departure of actress Ruth Codd and YouTube prankster Niko Omilana, the gameplay never sank into celebrities needlessly protecting each other because they were mates. Thank God.
So, what made this show so special, at a time when reality television is already so saturated? Read on to find out…
What a series of the #CelebrityTraitors . Here is my supercut video of all of the best bits. pic.twitter.com/ETEZAOHEvO
Let’s not kid ourselves here. Until they stepped it up in the final few episodes, and finally banished Traitor host Jonathan Ross, the celebrities were completely hopeless.
Celebrities aren’t smarter than the rest of us, but sometimes their elevated status, treatment and constant attention can fool you into thinking they are. Here, the celebrities banished a Faithful at the roundtables five consecutive times. Five! At one point, nearly 40% of the remaining contestants were Traitors, which was worse than any British iteration of the show to date. Like Carr, if I were one of the producers I would have likely turned to drinking double rosés, in the unthinkable and unprecedented event that the Faithfuls were so bad there were none of them actually left three episodes before the ending.
It was a tonic to see them being rubbish, and it wasn’t just at the roundtables either. Clare Balding, a respected broadcaster who has hundreds of hours of hosting Olympic and Paralympics coverage under her belt, messed up a mission for everyone within seconds because she didn’t understand the basic written instructions. Later, when “Bridget Jones” actress Celia Imrie was murdered in plain sight, journalist Kate Garraway assumed it might have been down to who had sun-dried tomatoes at dinner. Delightful.
The most ridiculous and failed accusation of the series, without a doubt, was when Olympian Tom Daley accused Garraway of being a Traitor after she said the word “flabbergasting” following singer and actress Paloma Faith’s funeral (that was a sentence I never thought I would write in my career, but we are where we are.)
“’Flabbergasting,’ who says such a word?” said a confident Agatha Christie, I mean Tom.
“You can’t say that someone is a Traitor because they have got a better vocabulary than you,” Carr responded.
Tom Daley’s blatant hatred for Kate is sending me into orbit #CelebrityTraitors pic.twitter.com/mUvw5VtHFH
Though Carr also delivered some of the best lines of the season — such as when Ross wore what looked like a “Flintstones” outfit and Carr responded “yabba dabba don’t” — it was Imrie who became the nation’s favorite.
Even though she had collaborated with Victoria Wood for years, her comic timing and deadpan delivery was a surprising delight. Before this series, who would have thought that Imrie farting would be the best TV moment of the whole year? But it was.
In fact, as the BAFTA Television Awards now have a TV Moment of the Year award, there’s a good chance that Imrie farting could actually win it. Just imagine… I would like to thank the Academy *parps*.
THIS MOMENT DESERVES A BAFTA #CelebrityTraitors pic.twitter.com/iD7kCq8gc0
Making Carr a Traitor was an inspired choice. After hopelessly trying to accuse Balding and Imrie of being Traitors, causing him to say “I am worse than Linda,” quoting the worst civilian Traitor of all time, the true joy was seeing Carr become an accidental serial killer who then got addicted to the bloodlust.
He sailed through roundtables even when he forgot that he had a shield. He even corpsed in the penultimate episode when he was asked to stare at the other celebrities and tell them that he was a Faithful.
Yet bizarrely, Alan being perceived as a bad Traitor was his greatest strength. It put everyone off the scent. Then, when fellow Traitor Cat Burns started to get bogged down in guilt, Carr merely reacted to the murder of Daley with: “He’s dead. Deal with it.”
Alan Carr has the best ever “best bits” montage that any reality tv show has ever produced #CelebrityTraitors #TheTraitors pic.twitter.com/iSfvSSR4ZU
It all came to an emotional climax during Thursday night’s finale. Carr, revealing that he was a Traitor after successfully convincing fellow finalists historian David Olusoga and “Ted Lesso” actor Nick Mohammed that he was a Faithful, unexpectedly buckled under guilt after winning the show and burst into tears. He apologized and said the secret had been “tearing me apart,” resulting in Mohammed, Olusoga and host Claudia Winkleman consoling him and reminding him of the amount of money he had fundraised for his chosen charity.
In a moment where most winners become the villain, Carr instead became a national treasure.
And the fact that the greatest moment of television this year was watched by the most viewers, 11 million, according to early figures? Even better.
TV moment of the year. That was a sensational ending. Alan Carr is DEFINITELY NOT the most hated person in the country right now #CelebrityTraitors pic.twitter.com/2mAuusq2Dd

Spain’s Filmax has pounced on the international sales rights to true survival tale “Balandrau: Where the Fierce Wind Blew,” in the run-up to the AFM .
Drama is inspired by actual events that took place in the Catalan Pyrenees and is based on the book “Les Tres Nits del Torb i un Cap d’Any” by Jordi Cruz.
Based on a screenplay by Danielle Schleif (“Mediterraneo: The Law of the Sea”), the drama focuses on the events that began on Dec. 30, 2000 when a group of mountaineers began their ascent of Balandrau (8,200 ft/ 2,500 m). What started as a clear, sunny climb quickly turned catastrophic as an unexpected blizzard struck – triggering one of the most severe storms ever recorded in the Pyrenees, the mountain spine of southern Europe.

The film is produced by Lastor Media (“Alcarràs,” “The Teacher Who Promised the Sea”), Vilaüt Films (“ Alcarras ,” “Creatura”), Goroka Contents (“Crims,” “Tor”) and 3Cat, with the participation of streaming platform, Filmin.
Said Lastor Media’s Tono Folguera: “We chose to make this film because the Balandrau story has such an exceptional cinematographic force. It is a real-life tragedy that impacted a whole country and one which reflects the relentless power of nature, human fragility and the strength of collective bravery when faced with the seemingly impossible.”
Guille Cascante, producer at Goroka Contents, added: “After directing a documentary about the Balandrau tragedy, which was nominated at the Gaudí Awards and became one of the most-watched in TV3’s history, we felt that this story still had so much to offer. Its impact motivated us to take it to the big screen, exploring new layers and offering different perspectives and we knew that Fernando Trullols was the perfect person to turn our vision into a compelling reality.”
“We’re extremely happy to have this film on our AFM slate. Its great combination of survival thriller and emotional elements result in a very commercial film that we’re sure will appeal to clients in many territories,” said Ivan Díaz, Filmax head of International, who will be presenting a promo reel during the market. Filmax aims to theatrically release the drama in Spanish cinemas by February next year.
The Barcelona-based company has been busy picking up a number of films and series. In September, it picked up musical comedy “Every Side of the Bed,” Basque exile drama “Karmele” by Asier Altuna and Basque-language thriller series “Mouths of Sky,” which debuted, like “Karmele,” at the San Sebastian Film Festival.

Trump’s undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere,' newspaper's editorial board says
By Todd Spangler
NY Digital Editor
The editorial board of the Washington Post , owned by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos , expressed approval of President Donald Trump ‘s “aggressive” move to tear down the White House ‘s East Wing in order to erect a massive ballroom funded by private corporations — including Amazon.
“Strong leaders reject calcification,” the Washington Post editorial board said in the op-ed , titled “In defense of the White House ballroom,” published Saturday. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“Many see the rubble [of the East Wing] as a metaphor for President Donald Trump’s reckless disregard of norms and the rule of law,” the Post’s editorial said. But others “see what they love about Trump: A lifelong builder boldly pursuing a grand vision, a change agent unafraid to decisively take on the status quo and a developer slashing through red tape that would stymie any normal politician.” Popular on Variety
“In classic Trump fashion, the president is pursuing a reasonable idea in the most jarring manner possible,” the Post editorial said. The piece claimed that privately, “many alumni of the Biden and Obama White Houses acknowledge the long-overdue need for an event space like what Trump is creating. It is absurd that tents need to be erected on the South Lawn for state dinners, and VIPs are forced to use porta-potties.”
Bezos, currently executive chairman of Amazon, bought the Washington Post in 2013 and owns it in his personal capacity. He has recently made several changes to the legendary paper, including overhauling the Post’s opinion section earlier this year to focus on “personal liberties and free markets” rather than “broad-based” issues. After Washington Post editorial opinion page editor David Shipley resigned following Bezos’ decision, the paper in June appointed Adam O’Neal, a former correspondent for the Economist and an opinion writer for the Wall Street Journal, as opinion editor.
Trump’s planned gold-gilded ballroom, to be built where the East Wing once stood, will cost an estimated $300 million. Amazon is one of the donors to the project, according to the White House.
The Post’s editorial acknowledged that “the fundraising for the ballroom creates problematic conflicts of interest,” but it did not identify Amazon as among the donors.
After raising those ethical issues without additional discussion, the Washington Post’s editorial board said in the piece that “Trump’s aggressive approach” is “justified.” The op-ed cited two examples: a yearslong delay in getting approvals for improving White House perimeter fencing after a 2014 incident in which a fence-jumper made his way inside the White House ; and an even longer approval process for the erection of the “modest” Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial near the National Air and Space Museum.
Other corporate donors to Trump’s new ballroom include Comcast, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and T-Mobile. Google also is listed as a donor; Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, agreed to pay Trump $22 million as part of settling the president’s lawsuit alleging “censorship” over YouTube’s suspension of his account for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. According to court documents, Trump directed the $22 million go toward the construction of the new White House ballroom.
In its Oct. 25 editorial, the Post said, “Preservationists express horror that Trump did not submit his plans to their scrutiny, but the truth is that this project would not have gotten done, certainly not during his term, if the president had gone through the traditional review process. The blueprints would have faced death by a thousand papercuts.”
“The White House cannot simply be a museum to the past,” the Post editorial concluded. “Like America, it must evolve with the times to maintain its greatness. Strong leaders reject calcification. In that way, Trump’s undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere.”
Trump’s teardown of the East Wing included the demolition of the White House’s 42-seat movie theater, which FDR installed in 1942. Over the years, the theater was home to President Barack Obama’s screenings with the casts and crews of “Lincoln” and “Selma”; Richard Nixon’s viewing of “Patton” the night before the Cambodia invasion; JFK’s second screening of “From Russia With Love” the day before he was assassinated in Dallas; and Jimmy Carter’s screening of “Apocalypse Now,” attended by Francis Ford Coppola, prior to the movie’s premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, according to the New York Times.
Trump himself once watched “one of his favorite movies,” Billy Wilder’s 1950 classic “Sunset Boulevard,” in the East Wing theater, per the Times.

NY Digital Editor
The already tense relations between Condé Nast and the union representing many of its editorial workers hit a new flash point this week.
The media and publishing company said it fired four employees “due to conduct that violated company policies.” In addition, Condé Nast said it filed a complaint Thursday with the National Labor Relations Board against the NewsGuild of New York, the union that reps the employees, for its “repeated and egregious disregard of our collective bargaining agreement.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
The NewsGuild-affiliated Condé United union blasted the terminations as “illegal” and said the four employees had a right to “demand answers on this week’s abrupt layoffs at multiple brands” including the consolidation of Teen Vogue under the main Vogue site. Popular on Variety
The flare-up came after Condé Nast on Monday announced that Teen Vogue’s website would be folded into Vogue.com and that Teen Vogue’s top editor, Versha Sharma, would be exiting. Chloe Malle, the recently hired head of editorial content at Vogue U.S. , is now overseeing what’s left of the Teen Vogue brand. The company had discontinued the print edition of Teen Vogue in 2017 .
According to the union, late Wednesday night, Condé Nast’s VP of labor relations notified the NewsGuild that the company was “immediately terminating four Condé United members for engaging in the protected concerted activity of gathering in their 1 World Trade Center office to demand answers on this week’s abrupt layoffs at multiple brands including Wired and the consolidation at Teen Vogue.” According to the company, there were no layoffs at Wired this week.
The union continued, “These egregious terminations are a flagrant breach of the Just Cause terms of our contract and an unprecedented violation of their federally protected rights as union members to participate in a collective action. Through these illegal terminations, Condé Nast management is attempting to intimidate and silence our members’ advocacy for the courageous cultural and political journalism of Teen Vogue, as well as diverting attention away from the obvious lack of corporate leadership at the company.”
Condé Nast characterized the sequence of events differently. The company said in a statement, “Extreme misconduct is unacceptable in any professional setting. This includes aggressive, disruptive, and threatening behavior of any kind. We have a responsibility to provide a workplace where every employee feels respected and able to do their job without harassment or intimidation. We also cannot ignore behavior that crosses the line into targeted harassment and disruption of business operations. We remain committed to working constructively with the union and all of our employees.”
The Condé Nast employees, who the union says were illegally fired, are: Alma Avalle, writer and digital producer at Bon Appetit, as well as NewsGuild of New York first vice president, trans activist and union leader; Jake Lahut, Wired senior reporter covering the Trump White House; Jasper Lo, senior fact checker at the New Yorker, as well as a U.S. Army veteran and outgoing first vice chair of the New Yorker Union; and Ben Dewey, videographer at Condé Nast Entertainment and former vice chair of the CNE unit.
“Management’s attempt at union-busting, using intimidation and grossly illegal tactics to try to suppress protected union activity, will not stand,” Susan DeCarava, president of the NewsGuild of New York, said in a statement. “The NewsGuild of New York has zero tolerance for bad bosses who harass, target and disrespect our fellow Guild members. We represent nearly 6,000 media workers across the tri-state area and we stand firmly in solidarity, ready to fight for the rights of our members illegally fired from their jobs at Condé.”
On Monday, the NewsGuild of New York and Condé United said they “strongly condemn” Condé Nast’s consolidation plans for Teen Vogue, “a move that is clearly designed to blunt the award-winning magazine’s insightful journalism at a time when it is needed the most.” According to the union, the company laid off six of its members, most of whom are “BIPOC women or trans,” including Teen Vogue politics editor Lex McMenamin.

Digital News Director
Seth Rogen recently told GQ magazine that after 11 years he is “pretty at peace” with what went down during the release of 2014’s “ The Interview .” The comedy, which Rogen co-wrote and starred in opposite James Franco, followed two Americans tasked by the CIA with assassinating North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un (played by Randall Park).
Notoriously, “The Interview” played a big role in the Sony hack . Data and emails from Sony employees were leaked online a few days before Thanksgiving 2014, and the hackers demanded the studio withdraw “The Interview’s” theatrical release. The studio also faced threats from North Korea, so it opted to skip a nationwide release and debut the film via online digital rentals and purchases. The group behind the Sony hack was “Guardians of Peace,” which had alleged ties to North Korea.

“It’s not a thing I think about that often anymore, so I guess I’m pretty at peace with it,” Rogen told GQ when the Sony hack and “The Interview” came up. “I still don’t know for sure if I know exactly what happened necessarily and exactly who did what and exactly the exact series of events that kind of transpired. I feel still as though maybe that truth is a little elusive to me at times, and I kind of go back and forth on what it might be.” Popular on Variety
When GQ then asked who was responsible for the Sony hack, Rogen replied: “I don’t know. Probably North Korea, but maybe with, in league with people in America, perhaps? Resentful employees from the Sony corporation is something that is a prevailing theory that’s been out there as well. So I don’t know. I feel as though North Korea definitely had something to do with it, but I don’t know if American people also had something to do with it.”
Rogen appeared on the “Hawk vs. Wolf” podcast in 2023 and admitted his life was “really bad and really catastrophic” in 2014 when all the Sony hack stuff was going down.
“People we knew were getting fired from it. The head of the studio [Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal] was essentially fired from it,” Rogen said. “It really caused seismic shifts in Hollywood at the time, and I think how business was done in some ways… [It also] re-calibrated what I think is controversial. After that, I was like, now I know what it’s like. Unless the president is giving news conferences about it, that’s controversy. If someone is getting mad about it on social media, that’s not controversy. Having like the U.N. have to make a statement about it, that’s a controversy.”
If there’s anything Rogen regrets about “The Interview,” it’s more about the movie itself and not the chaos that ensued around it. He told GQ the movie “could have used maybe another set comedy piece in the second half of the second act that could have bolstered the comedy in some ways.”
“It’s so funny because that’s my perspective on it,” Rogen added. “With everything that went wrong with this movie, I’m like, ‘We could have used another set piece around page 70.’ To me, that’s what I view as something that if I could go back, I would do differently with the movie. I just feel like I have a better understanding now of what a comedy film needs in order to really delight an audience in the way that I want to.”

Set to open Nov. 7 with the daring musical “They Will Be Dust” by Carlos Marqués -Marcet, the A-listed Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (aka PÖFF) will get an extra kick to its fierce spirit of independence and revolt from its first Focus on Catalonia, one of the highlights of this 29 th edition.
Under the aegis of PÖFF’s own Pasionaria-festival honcho Tiina Lokk and her 20 programmers, this year’s expanded program consists of 252 feature films and 275 short films from 79 countries, 111 world and 31 international premieres.

Among the buzziest titles bowing in the official competition are “Versailles” by Mexico’s Andrés Clariond (“Hilda”), “The Moon is a Father of Mine” by Crystal Globe winner George Ovashvili, “Think of England” by BAFTA-nominated Richard Hawkins, “The Frog and the Water” by Golden Bear-nominated Thomas Stuber and “The Muralist” by PÖFF 2024 Grand Prize winner Sengedorj Janchivdorj. Popular on Variety
The public-facing event will delight its audience with starry names including James McAvoy , in Tallinn with his directorial debut “California Schemin,” Iranian-French Golshifteh Farahani, cast in the Critics’ Pick entry “Oh’ What Happy Days,” and Cannes-selected helmer Sergei Loznitsa with “Two Prosecutors.”
Other highlights include a bolstered Baltic competition program, a “Yellow-Blue Butterfly” tribute to Ukrainian children, a Lifetime Achievement accolade to legendary Lithuanian actor Juonas Budraitis, and an Honorary Award to Austrian helmer Jessica Hausner.
More than 1,700 accredited guests from over 50 countries will fill the festival’s headquarters at the Nordic Hotel Forum, cornering the picturesque Unesco World Heritage Tallinn Old Town.
Below, Lokk unlocks her festival’s program and challenges to Variety .
Catalonia’s fierce creativity and spirit of independence will run through the veins of PÖFF 2025, as you’ve invited 70 participants from Catalonia and more than 30 films, including the opener “There Will Be Dust.” How did this collaboration come about?
Tiina Lokk : Firstly, I love Spanish cinema and our audience usually enjoys anything coming from Spain.  Secondly, Catalonia has a very strong culture and regional identity, and as strangely as it might sound, the small country of Estonia also shares distinctive regionalism.
But I must say I was astonished to discover the extraordinarily rich and varied Catalan film culture and genres. Being a passionate person, with my team, we picked as many films as we could for the Focus and sprinkled them across the festival’s sections – from classics, competition, experimental, midnight, documentaries and kids and youth, on top of TV series. The Catalan industry as a whole is immensely creative, active in co-productions and they get a lot of financial support from the region and local broadcasters. I almost wish I could live in Catalonia and stage my festival there!
You’re also staging a Spotlight on Austria and welcoming Jessica Hausner for a masterclass at the Discovery Campus. Is it a premiere as well for PÖFF?
Lokk: Yes it’s the first time we have such a larger delegation from Austria [around 20 people] and we’ll screen around seven-eight films instead of the usual two or three.
Jessica is one of the most interesting and outstanding Austrian filmmakers besides Michael Haneke. She doesn’t shy away from tackling very painful topics that other female directors don’t want to discuss so openly  – the weight of social, moral norms –  which is why we’ve invited her. She will receive an Honorary Award during the closing ceremony.
Having received 1,900 submissions for your main program, plus 433 kids and youth films and over 5,600 shorts, what’s your take of the state of global filmmaking?
Lokk: I guess there is still a slight post-COVID effect on filmmaking, and we can see that the level of production has dropped in Europe due to budget cuts, but we do have more or less the same number of films for the main program.
In geographical terms, our strongest entries come from Spanish-speaking countries, South America, Asia, Central Asia and Europe. But to be fair, it always depends what titles are available for our festival slot and what other festivals pick up.
How was your selection process this year? Despite your November slot that you’ve often described as “tricky,” you have selected an impressive 111 world premieres and 31 international premieres….
Lokk: I think that over the past decade, we have developed from strength to strength with our festival, industry, educational strand Discovery Campus and carved ourselves a niche on the festival circuit. That said, I am realistic. Cannes, Venice, Berlin will always attract the bigger A-list stars because our market remains very small and we have a restricted budget. Also, flight connections to Tallinn remain problematic. I often say  – with my black humor  – that we do snatch big names from the destinations with a direct flight to Tallinn.
You have a larger than usual number of British films in the main program: “Think of England” in the official selection, James McAvoy coming with “California Schemin” and “Lady’ competing here after a successful launch in London…
Lokk: Many British and Irish films prefer to have a London Film Festival launch as London is a gateway to the American market. I totally understand that. But we do get more submissions from producers and sales agents who know our taste for artistically-driven, edgy, even quirky films.
One key criterion though for me is to select films that I know will strike the right chord with our audience, that is well-educated, always fill our cinemas and actively take part in Q&As. We take great care of our audience.
For the first time you have two distinct competition strands for Baltic fiction films and Baltic documentaries. Why this move?
Lokk: Baltic feature films have upped their artistic level and enjoyed a boom in recent years, and it was clear that we needed to back this trend. We felt that quality documentaries from the region perhaps don’t get such a good entry-ticket on the international festival circuit and wanted to give them that extra well-deserved media and audience attention that you get from a competition slot. Although IDFA takes place at the same time, there are enough quality Baltic docs to screen at both festivals.
Last year you had three Baltic films in official selection but none this year. Any comment on this and on the state of Estonian cinema?
Lokk: Every small film country has some weaker years than others. Estonian fiction films have been lagging behind quality-wise, and that’s been going on for a while. This is due to the lack of funding for film. Also, filming here is becoming too expensive, due to the higher prices and inflation compared to Latvia and Lithuania, that are attracting even Estonian filmmakers. That said, positive signs are coming from north-eastern Estonia, with the Ida-Viru creative and technological hub and the Jõhvi studio complex set to open already in 2026. That will boost our facilities, industry skills and hopefully bring in a new breeze to the Estonian film industry.
Can you say a few words about the Lifetime Achievement to Lithuanian actor Juozas Budraitis, often called the ’James Dean’ of the Baltics?
Lokk: Somehow, this is connected to my past. When I entered the film industry in Estonia in the early 1980s, I noticed that many excellent filmmakers and actors who had played a big role in the development of cinema at the time, could never be noticed or recognised because of the political situation. Juozas was one of them. Though once invited to appear in a film by Michelangelo Antonioni, travel restrictions of the era kept him from taking up the role. Decades later, he made a memorable appearance in Netflix’s “The Queen’s Gambit” –  a quiet reminder of an artist whose presence transcends time and circumstance.
How have the on-going conflicts  – Ukraine at your doorstep, and between Israel and Palestine – impacted your selection process this year? Last year you encountered serious backlash with the Russian film “Deaf Lovers”….
Lokk: It’s never easy. I’m always in the middle of conflicts and even now, before festival kick off, I have to solve some sensitive issues. But that’s a normal part of life right now. However, I firmly stick to my principles of independence and artistic freedom and always try to make balanced choices. This year, I do have films both from Israel and Palestine, and with Ukraine, we have another huge collaboration. We will stage an event called Yellow-Blue Butterfly to support Ukrainian children impacted by war.
Ukraine knows about the value of culture as soft power and spends a lot of money explaining to the world what’s going on in their country. I wish our government would also see the importance of culture and stop making cuts.
Could you tell us about PÖFF’s first-ever fundraising campaign -– The Wolf Pack – to find alternative ways to raise financing for the festival?
Lokk: We are not the first– and not the last – festival to use a fundraising campaign. Toronto is one of the biggest to do this, and so do many festivals in the U.S. We have big problems and I’m not talking about developing our activities, but simply surviving. As I said earlier, living costs are rising, but we don’t want to increase our tickets. The Wolf Pack is a way to connect our festival with everyone involved and external benefactors and allow them to contribute financially to PÖFF’s sustainability and success.
As a former academic, you’ve integrated education into PÖFF, with the wide-ranging Discovery Campus program to be attended by 40 emerging professionals and talents. You must be pleased that big names such as costume designer Debra McGuire, composers Miriam Cutler, Atli Örvarsson and Jessica Hausner will share their knowledge with the next generation of film and TV talents?
Lokk: The educational segment of our festival is essential as we collaborate with film schools and educational networks internationally. We try to combine the needs of our industry on a local, regional and international level. Again, the Baltics are small production hubs, therefore, it’s key to boost talents and networking opportunities for local technicians and filmmakers. Next year we would like to develop our educational program, widen the collaborations with film schools to make it even more focused and beneficial for everyone.

The highly anticipated season finale of “ Celebrity Traitors U.K.” leaked briefly in Canada ahead of its broadcast on the BBC Thursday night.
According to BBC News , the finale was uploaded in error and watched by a few hundred people on the Canadian streaming service Crave. It was removed after a couple of hours; however, those who did view the episode have now taken to social media. A similar mistake also occurred on the streamer ThreeNow in New Zealand.

A BBC spokesperson said that the uploading of the episode was not the BBC’s fault and encouraged those who have seen it not to share spoilers. “We kindly ask anyone who thinks they know the outcome of ‘The Celebrity Traitors’ to keep whatever they believe they know to themselves,” the statement said. “Please avoid sharing potential spoilers so that the millions of fans who have been faithfully following every twist and turn of the series can enjoy the final this evening.” Popular on Variety
A spokesperson for All3Media International, the distribution arm of All3Media, said: “We are deeply sorry that the final of ‘The Celebrity Traitors’ was made available in Canada and New Zealand ahead of its scheduled BBC One premiere transmission. This occurred due to an internal miscommunication regarding release dates. The episode was taken down immediately once the issue was identified. We recognize the importance of protecting the viewing experience for audiences, particularly for a series where secrecy is central to the format. We are urgently reviewing our processes to ensure this does not happen again.”
The current season of “Celebrity Traitors U.K.” — which has narrowed down to singer-songwriter Cat Burns, comedian Alan Carr, rugby player Joe Marler, “Ted Lasso” star Nick Mohammed and writer David Olosuga — is the most-watched TV show of the year, averaging 12.6 million viewers in its first four episodes. On Thursday night, it will be determined whether the traitors or the faithfuls will win a £100,000 prize for charity.
The finale of “Celebrity Traitors U.K.” will air on BBC One at 9 p.m. U.K. time, with an extended version set on BBC Two afterwards.

On today’s episode of “Daily Variety” podcast, Variety ’s Todd Spangler weighs in on the collision of AI and Big Tech jobs as layoff notices fly. And Jennifer Maas discusses the growth of indie streamer Dropout .
Spangler explains that Big Tech is making cuts not because of financial pressure but in an effort to anticipate an AI-fueled future.
“The tech companies are trying to get ready for what they see as just this future wave of AI coming. So they’re investing heavily, including Amazon — billions and billions. Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon — they all raised their capital expenditure estimates for the coming year because they’re investing more in data centers to power AI applications,” Spangler says. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
“At the same time, Amazon said that they’re cutting, about 4% of their total white collar workforce — 14,000 jobs. That’s a big number. And this came after a memo that Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sent to the staff in June, saying ‘We’re going to get efficiency from using AI, and that’s going to result in a net reduction in our corporate headcount.’ So that’s how this came down. And then on the earnings call three days later, Jesse maybe had second thoughts about being looking like the the vanguard of AI-driven layoffs. He said this is about culture, basically saying that they overhired during the spike in demand that they saw during the pandemic, and that produced more layers of job functions that they can make more efficient,” he says. Popular on Variety
As for Dropout, the company has a base of subscribers who are so dedicated to the indie streamer’s particular brand of humor that they want to pay more per month without getting anything in return. The company, built up from the ashes of College Humor, has reached about 1 million subscribers.
Maas explains that Dropout made effective use of their most ardent fans in the marketing that accompanied news of the price hike to $6.99, from $5.99.
“And so they actually then used in a marketing announcement to announce this new tier. They used all the social media posts where people were saying, I would love to pay you more money. I would love to pay more for this. This is great. Your content’s great. So they said, OK, we’re launching a superfan tier. It will cost you $129.99 annually. You will get a few extra things here and there. You’ll get access to exclusive merch. You might get like early access to ticket sales,” Maas says. “They’re just giving you an opportunity to pay more as you asked for because you won’t get any exclusive shows that someone on the regular tier doesn’t have access to. You could get maybe like a behind the scene look here and there. But they’ve made the promise that what you get on Dropout is what you’ll get on Superfan, and you’re just getting the opportunity to pay more as you asked for.”

I would say that optics matter very little, because I think that at any other studio which wasn’t run by a millennial mogul who’s the son of the second richest person in the world, there might be a little bit more fear of like, ‘Oh, will people on social media say that we laid off too many women’ or cut too many programs that were considered progressive or whatever,” Siegel says. “I don’t think that David Ellison is concerned with optics, And then the CBS News of it all and Bari Weiss. It’s like a hydra with multiple tentacles of different dramas unfolding.”
Paramount’s focus when it comes to content has shifted significantly along with the political winds in the country. In keeping with the focus of Ellison’s Skydance Media, the new-model Paramount is eschewing art house in favor of big tent movies and TV shows that will appeal to the vast expanse of America.
“The biggest deal that David Ellison has struck since taking over the studio is this UFC [rights] deal. It’s worth $7.7 billion over seven years. That’s almost what the full price tag was for Paramount itself,” Siegel says. “And one of the interesting things I uncovered in the reporting is that  –I’m sorry, I have to laugh because there’s something so crazy about it — there’s going to be a UFC fight on the White House lawn [next year] and that’s quite frankly astonishing. The White House gave me a comment and said ‘It’ll be a spectacular event.’ It’s something that five years ago, I might not have been able to envision.”
Willman, who is Variety ‘s chief music critic, sheds light on the growing popularity of Acrisure Arena in Palm Desert, Calif., just south of Palm Springs. It seats about 10,000 people for concerts. It’s big enough to test-drive a big rock show, small enough to still feel intimate and far away enough from Los Angeles (about 120 miles east) to count as an out-of-town tryout, as Willman explains.
“One of the advantages of it is that for the acts that are coming in, like Paul McCartney and like Olivia Rodrigo who also started her tour there, they can rehearse there. They can book the arena for a week or two ahead of the first night. Irving Azoff used the phrase ‘They can hang their show.’ That’s industry-ease that they can put the full production on stage there because the stage is as big as any stage at the Forum or the Hollywood Bowl or anywhere else. Even though the the audience is only two-thirds the size, the stage is as big,” Willman says. “So when those acts play the Acrisure, they definitely want to do their full show. It’s a couple hours away from the industry. It’s a couple hours away from too many friends coming by to bug you unless you want them to come out. And so it’s that sweet spot of the out-of-town tryout in Broadway terms.”

TV Business Writer
Microsoft reported its latest quarterly earnings results Wednesday, revealing that gaming revenue decreased $113 million (2%). The tech company attributed the decline to a nearly 30% drop in Xbox hardware sales “offset in part by growth in Xbox content and services.”
Revenue from Xbox content and services, which includes Xbox’s Game Pass subscription service and sales of its first-party video games, was $5.5 billion for the July-September quarter, up 1% from the comparable period in 2024.

Per Microsoft, “Xbox hardware revenue decreased 29% driven by lower volume of consoles sold. Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% on a strong prior year comparable with growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content, offset in part by a decline in first-party content.” Popular on Variety
In the previous reporting quarter, which ran April-June, Xbox sales were down 22%. The next time Microsoft reports earnings, those results should include details on sales for the recently launched handheld devices, ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X .
For Microsoft’s most recent quarter, which marks its first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $3.66 on $75.4 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG. Microsoft reported adjusted EPS of $3.72 on $77.7 billion in revenue.
“Our planet-scale cloud and AI factory, together with Copilots across high value domains, is driving broad diffusion and real-world impact,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft chairman and CEO, said in a letter to shareholders. “It’s why we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.”
“We delivered a strong start to the fiscal year, exceeding expectations across revenue, operating income, and earnings per share,” said Amy Hood, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Microsoft. “Continued strength in the Microsoft Cloud reflects the growing customer demand for our differentiated platform.”

Catalonia ’s biggest titles of 2025, “Romería” and “Sirat,” both Cannes competition hits, will screen at Tallinn. So will “Deaf,” a Berlin 2025 Panorama Audience Award winner. It is a mark of the volume of quality films now produced in Catalonia that this take on 12 Titles to Track takes in only titles which have hit festivals since Venice. Even so, it’s a baker’s dozen, and still omits titles s¡well worthy of selection such as “Strange River.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Titles play out through the whole of Tallinn, from main competition (“The Good Daughter”), Tallinn’s TV Beats Co-Financing Market (“Dark Waters”) and Children’s Competition (“The Treasure of Barracuda”), to mention just a few sections.
Notably, 12 of the 13 titles, even if projects, are already international co-productions, with Belgium the co-production country of choice, partnering on five titles. A significant majority, eight, have female directors or creators. Popular on Variety

“Climacteric,” (Liliana Torres, Edna Cinema, Distinto Films, Spain, Poland)

“Frontera,” (Judith Colell, Coming Soon, Diagonal, Crespeth Films, Spain; Bulletproof Cupid, Belgium)
Harnessing the period drama expertise of Banijay’s Diagonal and its key crew, a crossover of historical thriller and arthouse social point which characterizes Collel (“Elisa K.,” “15 Hours”). Set in a high Pyrenees village in 1943, a Catalan customs officer defies orders, helping Jews escape from Nazi-occupied France. Sold to Menemsha, studied in its craft, genuinely tense and gorgeously shot, highlighting the heavenly mountains and a historical hell.
“The King of the Air” (Laura Ferrés, Materia Cinema, La Fabrica Nocturna Cinéma, Spain, France)
The sophomore pic from Ferrés after her Valladolid winner “The Permanent Picture” and multi-awarded Cannes-selected short “The Disinherited.” In the melodrama, co-written by Ferres and Chema García Ibarra (“The Sacred Spirit”), Pere is saved from suicide by Rosario and regains the will to live. However, Rosario is in love with Celeste, her financial dominatrix.

“Last Night I Conquered the City of Thebes,” (“Anoche conquisté a Tebas,” Gabriel Azorín, Dvein Films, Filmika Galaika and Bando à Parte, Spain, Portugal)

Marta and Antonio, partners of many years, quarrel and suddenly break up. Flashing back to their time together, the film anticipates the final goodbye where Marta receives a devastating medical diagnosis. “In other hands, this would cue a standard disease-of-the-week weepie, but Coixet keeps the tone lightly wistful and wise,” Variety says.
“The Treasure of Barracuda,” (Adrià Garcia, Inicia Films, Hampa Studio, Belvision, Spain, Belgium)
Garcia’s first animated feature after Goya winner “Nocturna,” a whimsical 2D animated adventure preserving the charm of  illustration in Llanos Campos’ popular novel, Sparks, a young orphan girl, joins a pirate crew in search of hidden treasure. “About pirates, yes, but also a moving fable about the power of reading to promote connection and the importance and value of chosen families,” Variety has written. “A film with style, quality, and a whole lot of personality,” says Ivan Díaz, at Filmax, which has rolled out sales on the title.
“Wolf Grrrls,” (“Salen las lobas,” Claudia Estrada Tarascó, Alba Sotorra, Paloma Productions, Novak Films, Spain, Belgium)

Disney World’s Animal Kingdom theme park has introduced a new show, “Zootopia: Better Zoogether.”
This nine-minute immersive experience opens Friday at the Florida park, celebrating the biomes of “ Zootopia. ” The show marks a full-circle moment for “ Zootopia 2 ” co-directors Jared Bush and Byron Howard , who began discussions over three years ago about bringing something unique to Animal Kingdom. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
“We began our journey on the first ‘Zootopia,’” Bush says. “We came here as part of our research, spending a lot of time with the animals here and behind the scenes.” Howard adds that working with Walt Disney Imagineers to conceive the idea was a great warm-up for the duo as they prepared to dive into “Zootopia 2.” “We hadn’t touched these characters for a while, so getting our character animators involved and learning how to move them around to do crazy things was exciting.” Popular on Variety
Among those “crazy things” are spitting walruses, an ice-skating spectacular and a mouse drone show.
The show itself blends 3D technology with 4D elements, immersing audiences in the sights, sounds, and smells of the “Zootopia” world. Bush and Howard collaborated closely with Chris Beatty, a Creative Portfolio Executive at Walt Disney Imagineering . Beatty emphasizes that the key to creating the show was telling a clear story in a short format.
“We don’t have a two-hour time period to settle into character development, their relationships, and who they are,” Beatty explains. “We have to be very clear about the story we want to tell and how we want to convey it to our guests.” For Imagineering, everything begins with the story. The team focused on the idea of interconnectedness among all living things and how these elements are symbiotic with each other. “Zootopia’s” narrative of harmony among different biomes provided Beatty’s team with a strong foundation. Once that was established, “It was easy to start imagining places like Tundra Town, Sahara Square, and new environments in development, like Marsh Market.”
Marsh Market is a fresh addition to the aquatic and reptilian environments of “Zootopia 2.” To submerge audiences in this world, Beatty says, “We’re using water — not just 3D animation of giant tongues coming out and lathering the audience.” He adds, “The water effects are synchronized perfectly, and the audience goes crazy.”
In addition to Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde returning, the show centers around Officer Clawhauser, voiced by Nate Torrence. Howard describes the beloved character Clawhauser as “our lucky charm.” He adds, “Everyone loves Claws. He’s a part of the first movie, the second movie, and now he’s a huge part of this show.” Howard concludes, “It makes complete sense to center the show around Clawhauser’s shenanigans.”
“Zootopia 2” opens in theaters nationwide on Nov. 26.

The Seville European Film Festival is taking a step toward mainstreaming animation, integrating animated titles throughout its lineup rather than cordoning them off in a single strand. The strategy underscores a broader European shift: Animation is increasingly accepted as a medium, not a genre, and less confined to being only kids or family centric.
Among the features, Sylvain Chomet ’s “A Magnificent Life,” the sole animated feature in Official Selection, offers a biographical portrait of French playwright and filmmaker Marcel Pagnol. Written and directed by Chomet, the film blends hand-drawn visual lushness with narrative reflection as Pagnol revisits his childhood in Provence, his early loves and his entry into cinema. Produced by What the Prod, Mediawan and partners, the feature screens in Seville as part of the celebration of Pagnol’s 130th anniversary.

In the European Film Academy selection, “Little Amélie or The Character of Rain” directed by Maïlys Vallade and Liane-Cho Han, adapts Amélie Nothomb’s childhood memoir “The Metaphysics of Tubes” into a hand-drawn reflection on early consciousness. Seen through the perceptions of a very young child in Japan and her bond with her caregiver, the film unfolds as a flow of images that map the world as it comes into being. Produced by Ikki Films and Maybe Movies, the title arrives in Seville following Audience Awards at Annecy and San Sebastián. Popular on Variety
Also featured in the lineup is Michel Gondry’s “Maya, Give Me a Title,” developed over five years from a long-distance game between the director and his daughter. To stay connected while living in different countries, Gondry would ask Maya to invent a film title, then animate it using his trademark cut-paper and collage techniques, always casting her as the lead. Across the film, Maya survives earthquakes, becomes a mermaid and even averts a tomato sauce catastrophe, a playful catalogue of imagined adventures shaped through a father-daughter exchange. Produced by Partizan Films and voiced by Maya Gondry and Blanche Gardin, the stop-motion work traces creativity as an act of connection.
Together these films point to a sector thriving on diversity of scale and method from hand-drawn introspection to studio-backed folklore epics and to the festival championing and adapting accordingly.
Variety profile the remaining animation titles – and there’s a considerable number – below:
“To the Woods” (Sacrebleu Productions, France)
Agnès Patron’s short, co-written with Johanna Krawczyk, depicts a sister recalling her lost brother through shifting, hand-drawn chiaroscuro. The film’s story emerged when the director, newly observing the bond between her two young children during the 2020 lockdown, began reflecting on sibling relationships in her own family. While writing with co-writer Johanna Krawczyk, she recognized that the emotional core traced back to her grandmother’s deep attachment to an older brother who died young – a connection carried throughout her life, and tied to the bittersweet shift from childhood wonder to adulthood. A meditation on memory’s persistence, the film relies on rhythm, contrast and gesture rather than dialogue.
“Dandelion’s Odyssey”(Planètes) (Miyu Productions, Ecce Films, France, Belgium)
Momoko Seto ’s poetic tale follows four dandelion seeds launched into space after Earth’s destruction. “‘Dandelion’s Odyssey’ connects with our ecological consciousness all around the world,” said Nicolas Eschbach, Indie Sales co-founder. “With its unique universe and captivating storytelling, we follow four dandelion seeds in an extraordinary tale of survival and perseverance,” he continued. The Fipresci and Annecy winning feature zooms in and gives story to the tiny living elements of our world. Oscar winner Nicolas Becker scores the wordless film. It marks Seto’s debut feature.
“The Horizon From the Tip of the Nose” (Self-produced, France)
Etienne Bonnet turns severe childhood myopia into a visual reflection on perception and closeness.

“Fish River Anthology” (Aalto University School of Arts, Seiza Films)
Set in a fish counter at closing time, Veera Lamminpää’s stop-motion short drifts into soft musical numbers and existential humor.

Distributed by Kurzfilm Agentur Hamburg, it demonstrates the continued strength of Nordic animation in hybrid tonal registers.
“Le Jardin Rossini” (Gobelins, France)
Hervé Rossini communicates through the surreal garden he has cultivated, and on the night of his final exhibition, that private world becomes a stage for questions of legacy and memory. Directed collectively by seven animation filmmakers from Gobelins, the short layers shifting visual styles to evoke an artist’s inner landscape at the threshold of departure. Voiced by Bernard Métraux and Mathilde Lamusse, the film reflects on what we leave behind and how others reinterpret it.

In this follow-up to “Chickenhare and the Hamster of Darkness,” half-chicken, half-hare adventurer Hopper sets out to find a legendary marmot said to possess the ability to turn back time — a power that may save his endangered species.

Premiered at Annecy, the film continues nWave’s family-focused animation slate.

Produced by Folimage and Les Armateurs, it offers a gentle rural adventure about curiosity, memory and the stories families carry.
“The Bird From Within” (Universidade Católica do Porto – Escola das Artes, Portugal)
Directed by Laura Anahory, co-written with Ana Anahory and Guilherme Mateus, this 2D and mixed-media short depicts a woman wrestling with the bird living inside her – a metaphor for internal conflict and self-regulation. Quietly paced and textural, the film extends the recent Portuguese tradition of psychologically attentive animation shorts.
“Éiru” ( Cartoon Saloon , HerStory, Ireland)

“Gilbert” (Agencia Freak, Spain)
Directed by Arturo Lacal, Alex Salu and Jordi Jiménez, the short follows Gilbert, who delivers packages by gondola across a tiny archipelago, and Sullivan, a trumpeter living next door.

Screened widely at festivals and shortlisted for the 2026 Goya Awards.
“Murmuration” (Spotted Bird, Beast Animation, and Murmur Animation, Belgium, Netherlands)

“Le Cantique des moutons” (Supinfocom Rubika, France)

“My Brother, My Brother” (Dnewar Brothers, Milkman Films, France, Germany, Egypt)
A dual-perspective account of identical twins recounting shared childhood and eventual separation. The short uses split-frame structures and layering to distinguish and overlap memory traces, highlighting animation’s ability to express simultaneous emotional states.

Variety Editor at Large
The increasingly ugly battle between CBS Media Ventures and Sony Pictures Television over the distribution of first-run syndicated megahits “ Wheel of Fortune ” and “ Jeopardy !” has come to a conclusion. Both sides sent out a joint press release on Friday, announcing that they had come to an “amicable resolution” over their legal battles regarding the two shows.
According to the settlement, international distribution of “Wheel” and “Jeopardy” will transition to Sony on December 1. The U.S. domestic distribution of both shows will continue to be handled by CBS through the 2027-2028 TV season, when that will also move to Sony. Marketing, promotions and affiliate relations for “Wheel” and “Jeopardy” will continue to be handled by CBS through this current 2025-2026 TV season, and then move to Sony.

Meanwhile, CBS will lead all advertising sales through at least the 2029-2030 TV season. (Sony had previously handled a limited inventory of spots.) There was no mention of the plan for ad sales after 2030 or if that might be extended. Popular on Variety
“We have reached an amicable resolution regarding the syndicated distribution of ‘Jeopardy!’ and ‘Wheel of Fortune,'” the companies said in their joint statement. “We look forward to working together to continue bringing these beloved shows to audiences and stations around the world.”
Sony and CBS have been partners on “Wheel” and “Jeopardy” for years, with Sony owning the shows and handling production, and CBS overseeing distribution. That oversight split comes from the legacy of how both shows came to be in the modern era: Merv Griffin Prods. created and owned both shows, and was acquired by Columbia Pictures Television (now Sony Pictures TV) in 1986; King World, which sealed syndication rights to “Wheel” from Griffin in 1983 and “Jeopardy” in 1984, was acquired by CBS in 1999.
That partnership was rocked in October 2024, when Sony filed a lawsuit , accusing CBS of self-dealing and failing to maximize revenues in its syndication of both shows. The suit alleged that CBS’ corporate shuffles had rendered it incapable of properly distributing the shows, and also said the Eye’s deals in New Zealand and Australia were unauthorized, plus accused CBS of putting its fully owned syndicated series on higher ranked TV stations than “Wheel” and “Jeopardy” in some markets.
In November 2024, CBS countersued , arguing that Sony had created a false pretext in order to get out of the 42-year-old King World distribution contract. “Sony is attempting to obtain in court what it could not get at the bargaining table: the rights to the Series for free, by finding any excuse it can muster,” the countersuit said.
In February, Sony sent CBS a formal letter announcing that it would take over distributing “Wheel” and “Jeopardy” to the 200+ TV stations that syndicate the shows. CBS responded to stations, asserting that Sony had “no rights” to take over distribution. CBS was also granted a restraining order , preventing Sony from immediately grabbing distribution.
“Sony Pictures owns, controls, produces, and finances ‘Jeopardy!’ and ‘Wheel of Fortune.’ In light of CBS’s continuous failure to live up to its contractual obligations, SPT believes it has lawfully terminated the distribution agreements with CBS for the shows and accordingly assumed all global distribution functions,” Sony said at the time. Responded CBS: “We’re pleased the court issued a temporary restraining order against Sony’s unlawful actions. We will continue to seamlessly distribute ‘Wheel of Fortune’ and ‘Jeopardy!’ to our station clients like we have for over 40 years.”
But then in April, a judge allowed Sony to take over distribution of both shows, finding that Sony was likely to prevail on its claim that CBS has failed to live up to its contractual obligations. And then a week later, CBS regained distribution again after a state appeals court sided with the Eye.
Here is the note sent to domestic and international business partners by CBS Media Ventures:
On behalf of Sony Pictures Television and CBS Studios Inc., we are thrilled to let you know that we have arrived at an amicable resolution to the pending litigation regarding Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune. While the precise terms of our settlement will remain confidential, CBS will remain the exclusive domestic distributor of the shows in syndication and continue to deliver the shows through the 2027/2028 season. Thereafter, domestic distribution will transition to SPT. Also, CBS will expand its role and exclusively lead all advertising sales through the 2029/2030 season. However, the marketing, promotions and affiliate relations for the shows will transition to SPT at the end of the 2025/2026 season. Further, SPT will continue to manage brand integrations. And international distribution of the shows will transition to SPT as of December 1, 2025. We look forward to working together to bring these beloved shows to stations and audiences around the world.

Artisans Editor
“ Hamnet ” production designer Fiona Crombie is no stranger to the world of William Shakespeare.
Over two decades ago, she designed “Hamlet” for Australia’s Bell Shakespeare Company. “I don’t think I really engaged with the sort of rumination on death in the way that we have through this film,” she says of Chloé Zhao’s “Hamnet,” based on Maggie O’Farrell’s 2020 novel. The film stars Paul Mescal as William Shakespeare and Jessie Buckley as his wife, Agnes, as the couple grieve the death of their 11-year-old son, Hamnet, and how William began to write his classic tragedy “Hamlet.” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
One set Crombie was tasked with was creating London’s Globe Theatre in the late 1500s. It was a big moment for Crombie and dominates the film’s third act. “[Zhao and I] wound up going back into London and sitting in the Globe together,” Crombie says. Zhao and Crombie had a conversation about whether to shoot there or not. “But it was never really a viable thing,” Crombie says. “When we sat there, we realized that it was, for our purposes, too ornate. And this is not the Globe that was right for our film.” Popular on Variety
London’s Globe, which continues as a vital center for theatrical offerings, had been rebuilt and reconstructed, and so, the decision was made for Crombie to build the Globe for the film, which gave her a creative freedom of sorts.
Zhao wanted something smaller and more intimate than the current theater. She noted she wanted to feel the audience  and the relationship with the stage. “We reduced ours to 75% of the actual Globe footprint,” says Crombie.
The other directive from Zhao is that she wanted the theater to look like the inside of a tree. “That set me on a path in terms of the use of all the reclaimed wood,” says Crombie. For the various builds for the Shakespeare family house, the attic and the Globes, Crombie had 20 tons of oak wood beams shipped in from France.
It took Crombie and her team 14 weeks to build the theater. “It’s deliberately not ornate. There’s beautiful joinery, if you love joinery, but the focus is on the stage. And that was a very deliberate choice, that this was very basic, and almost like a vessel for his plays,” she says.
Crombie also notes that the wood had been aged, which was perfect for the nar- rative. She explains, “This was meaningful for me, for both the Globe and the [Shake- speare] house — that the timber came with scars.”
She adds that there are anecdotes that the first Globe, where Shakespeare saw his plays performed, was made from reclaimed wood, “so it felt right that it was not all new lumber.”
On reflection, Crombie says she was struck by the juxtaposition of “nature and the controlled form of those Tudor houses, with the whitewash and the heavy beams. And in Agnes’ world, you’ve got a rambling nature.”
Her research relied heavily on paintings from the time, and she found herself using a lot of soft, earthy tones. Inside the Shakespeare family home, she used black walls with painted detail. “This is a family who had been successful, who had had money and they’d lost their money. And so there were these things about that house that indicated a level of choice and decoration that had then faded and was in decline,” Crombie says.

NY Digital Editor
Tubi is making its first podcast play: The Fox Corp.’s Tubi Media Group struck a multiyear deal with Audiochuck , founded by Ashley Flowers , for exclusive distribution and ad sales rights to shows including “ Crime Junkie ,” which consistently ranks as the No. 1 true-crime podcast.
The agreement is valued at approximately $150 million, per the Wall Street Journal , citing an anonymous source. The Tubi deal includes the development of a “Crime Junkie” FAST channel to be distributed across Tubi and the Fox One subscription service as well as third-party platforms, and an on-demand collection of video podcast episodes. As part of the deal, Tubi Media Group’s Red Seat Ventures will assume management of ad sales across Audiochuck’s suite of programs and podcasts.

“Crime Junkie” and Audiochuck’s other shows will continue to be available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube and other major podcast platforms. With the Tubi deal, Audiochuck is exiting its distribution and sales pact with SiriusXM, originally signed in 2021 and runs through 2025. Popular on Variety
In addition to “Crime Junkie,” Audiochuck’s podcast network includes more than 20 weekly and seasonal shows including “The Deck,” “Counter Clock,” “Park Predators” and “Dark Downeast.” The company claims its podcast draw more than 10 million monthly listeners and about 2 million per episode.
Earlier this year, Audiochuck received $40 million in funding from Peter Chernin’s The Chernin Group , the first outside capital for Audiochuck, which valued the Indianapolis-based company at about $250 million. Flowers controls and owns a majority of Audiochuck, and TCG owns a minority share.
“Ashley and her team have built a truly unique and premium media company with a strong commitment to meaningful, award-winning storytelling that carries positive social impact,” said Paul Cheesbrough, CEO of Tubi Media Group. “Having admired her achievements for some time, we’re now thrilled to be in partnership with Audiochuck, bringing to bear our platforms and commercial expertise in the continued evolution and growth of the business.”
Founded in 2017 by Flowers, Audiochuck specializes in true crime and mystery storytelling. Its flagship podcast is “Crime Junkie,” hosted by Flowers and Brit Prawat, which ranked as Apple Podcasts’ No. 1 true-crime podcast of 2024 (and the No. 2 overall podcast after the New York Times’ “The Daily”). The “Crime Junkie” brand is supported by more than 20 full-time writers, fact-checkers, researchers and editors. The team actively reports on and evaluates more than 50 cases at once, and the Audiochuck network has reported on nearly 1,000 cases to date, according to the company.
Flowers, founder and chief creative officer of Audiochuck, said in a statement, “This first-of-its-kind partnership represents the next evolution of what independent media can achieve. By joining forces with Tubi, we’re not just expanding our reach — we’re redefining how true crime stories are experienced across audio and video. It’s an incredible opportunity to innovate while staying true to the purpose and integrity that have guided Audiochuck from day one.”
Audiochuck CEO Matt Starker said the deal with Tubi “allows us to extend our reach and reimagine how true crime stories are told across both audio and video. I believe deeply in Tubi Media Group’s creator-led media vision and am excited to help them build a world-class creator monetization business.”
Audiochuck next week is launching its latest show, “Chameleon,” a new weekly podcast produced with Campside Media. It premieres Nov. 13 with two episodes. “Chameleon” explores “the fascinating and often shocking world of people pretending to be someone they’re not,” providing a deep dive “into the stories of scammers, con artists and other deceptive individuals who operate in plain sight,” per Audiochuck.
Audiochuck says it has led fundraising efforts that have led to more than $8.5 million in donations to local communities and organizations serving those affected by crime. In addition, the company says that six cold cases have been “solved with the support of the Audiochuck community.” In 2020, Flowers founded Season of Justice in 2020, a nonprofit organization that has assisted in 152 cases and is dedicated to providing funding to investigative agencies and families to help solve cold cases.

GrX Studio , the production company behind crime thrillers “Copycat Killer” and “The Victims’ Game,” is showcasing its latest project at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest ( TCCF ). “ The Ones I Killed and The Ones Who Killed Me ” is a psychological crime drama with plans for a U.S.-Taiwan co-production.
The series, adapted from Akira Higashiyama’s novel of the same name, follows a Taiwanese psychiatrist who becomes entangled in U.S. serial killings spanning three decades. Each body serves as a brutal message, forcing him to confront a past he desperately tried to forget. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“The inspiration comes from the novel’s capture of the fragile beauty of childhood friendship and the painful contrast that comes with adulthood,” producer Lee Wen-yi and executive producer Tseng Han-hsien tell Variety . “That became the starting point for our adaptation.” Popular on Variety
The narrative centers on two childhood friends, Jason and Morris, who grew up in dysfunctional families and vowed to become each other’s family. “They are twin flames — light and shadow, yin and yang — illuminating each other’s tragic lives,” the producers explain. “But one incident tears them apart, and their fates are reversed.”
When the pair reunite as adults, they find themselves on opposite sides of morality: Jason works as a psychiatrist assisting police, while Morris has become a serial killer challenging society’s definition of sanity. “The mystery of the crime is no longer about who the killer is, but how evil comes into being,” the producers note. “Have we, in order to survive, ever killed the kindness in another’s soul? Perhaps the real culprit is society itself.”
The project represents GrX Studio’s continued exploration of the crime-thriller genre. “From ‘Copycat Killer’ to ‘The Victims’ Game,’ the GrX team has continued to explore and expand the possibilities of the crime-thriller genre,” the producers say. “With ‘The Ones I Killed and The Ones Who Killed Me,’ we aim to take that vision even further — deepening our psychological and moral inquiry while pushing creative boundaries.”
The series will begin with a murder in Los Angeles, unfolding through the perspective of a Taiwanese psychiatrist who has lived in the U.S. for years as he reflects on his childhood in Taiwan. Filming is planned for both the U.S. and Taiwan, with the team actively seeking international co-production partners at TCCF.
The project’s timing is deliberate. “The world has been changing rapidly in recent years,” the producers observe. “Across many countries, anti-immigration sentiments are rising, and people have begun to engage in deeper discussions about identity and immigration policies.” They note that original author Akira Higashiyama, who was born in Taiwan and later moved to Japan, brings a unique perspective on how different cultures shape identity.
“At its creative core, the series explores the interdependent relationship between good and evil — like yin and yang — as a way to examine belonging and otherness,” the producers say. “The title itself suggests a mirror-like connection, just as the relationship between an investigator and a suspect in a crime thriller often reflects two sides of the same coin.”
The script is currently 80% complete, with the writing team aiming to finalize it by year’s end. Pre-production is slated for Q3 2026, with filming scheduled to commence in Q1 2027.
The creative team includes executive producer Hank Tseng, known for his global perspective and keen market insight in developing culturally rich, cross-border content. Producer Lee Wen-yi brings expertise in crafting narratives that explore human complexity and social structures. The writing team comprises John Cheng, who specializes in social realism and crime genres rooted in Taiwanese culture; Chen Cheng-yu, a senior screenwriter based in the U.S. with experience in American TV structure and writers’ room dynamics; Peng Huai-de, whose versatile storytelling balances emotional depth with entertainment value; and Cheng Wen-ting, who holds a master’s degree from NTUA’s Department of Radio and Television.
GrX Studio encompasses film and television production, talent management, IP development, and business strategy, with a presence across the Asian market.

TV Business Writer
“ Grand Theft Auto VI” has been delayed again by Take-Two Interactive’s Rockstar Games, this time pushed six months from its previously set May 2026 release date .
Along with its July-September quarterly earnings results Thursday, Take-Two announced the much-anticipated action-adventure open world title will now launch Nov. 19, 2026.
In a letter to shareholders accompanying the financial results, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick did not give a reason for the “ GTA 6 ” delay, but noted, “we remain both excited and confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience.” Popular on Variety Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“In this instance, of course, we’re seeking to release the most extraordinary title anyone’s ever seen in the history of entertainment,” Zelnick told Variety in an interview ahead of the announcement Thursday. “That’s a tall order. And in this instance, Rockstar Games believes a limited amount of additional time is required for polish to support that view.”
The Take-Two team says that the recent firings of approximately 30-40 employees at Rockstar Games in the U.K. is unrelated to the “GTA 6” delay.
While a U.K. union claims the employees were let go in a “union-busting” move, Rockstar said in a statement Wednesday these staffers “were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies” and the cuts were “in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”
“These two matters are entirely separate, and the reasons that we’ve given for each,” a spokesperson for Take-Two said Thursday. “And I think to conflate the two would not only be misleading, it would be highly erroneous. So these are two entirely separate issues.”
Now in development for more than a decade, Rockstar’s “GTA 6” was originally on target for a fall 2025 release until the developer finally announced this May that the game would not be ready until May 26, 2026. Since that time, all remarks from Take-Two have pointed to “GTA 6” making that date.
Rockstar said in a statement posted to X Thursday : “Hi everyone, Grand Theft Auto VI will now release on Thursday, November 19, 2026. We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve. We want to thank you again for your patience and support. While the wait is a little longer, we are incredibly excited for players to experience the sprawling state of Leonida and a return to modern day Vice City.  Sincerely, Rockstar Games”
In addition to the “GTA 6” shuffle news, Take-Two updated its release calendar Thursday to include “BioShock next iteration” from 2K and “Top Goal” from Zynga, both with “TBA” launch dates.
Wall Street forecast a loss of earnings per share (EPS) of 62 cents on $1.74 billion in revenue for Take-Two, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG. Take-Two reported a GAAP net loss of 73 cents per share (or $133.9 million) on $1.77 billion in revenue. Net bookings were $1.96 billion and non-GAAP earnings stood at $116.7 million.
For the July 1-Sept. 30 quarter, Take-Two had projected net bookings between $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion and a GAAP net loss per share between 75 cents and 60 cents (a loss of $136 million to $110 million).
Take Two says top revenue drivers for the quarter were “NBA 2K26” and “NBA 2K25,” “Borderlands 4,” “Toon Blast,” “Grand Theft Auto Online” and “Grand Theft Auto V,” “Match Factory!,” “Color Block Jam,” “Mafia: The Old Country,” “Empires & Puzzles,” “Words With Friends,” “Red Dead Redemption 2” and “Red Dead Online,” and “Toy Blast.”
Take-Two is now projecting net bookings between $1.55 billion and $1.6 billion for the October-December period a net loss per share between 49 cents and 35 cents. The company has raised the estimated net bookings for its current full fiscal year (ending March 31, 2026) to between $6.4 billion and $6.5 billion.

What do a bottle of water, a piece of candy and Greek cinema have in common?
That’s the question posed by a provocative ad running ahead of screenings at this year’s Thessaloniki Film Festival , highlighting the dire state of film funding in Greece.
The 60-second animated spot, which was produced as part of the wider Visibility Zero movement, spotlights how the country ranks dead last in Europe when it comes to public support for its audiovisual industry.

As the ad points out, Greece’s selective funding scheme — which is related specifically to domestic productions and international co-productions — had a budget of just €6.5 million ($7.5 million) in 2025, putting it last among the continent’s screen industries relative to GDP. At 63 cents a head, this per capita expenditure amounts to roughly the cost of a bottle of water and a throat lozenge for every Greek citizen. Popular on Variety
Bolstered by a growing coalition of international supporters, Greek filmmakers are calling on their government to shore up their struggling film biz before it’s too late.
“The Greek state has to take a decision to further support the selective programs. Because right now, we cannot be competitive with the money that is [available],” said filmmaker Syllas Tzoumerkas, who directed the 2019 Berlinale premiere “The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea” and whose last film, “The City and the City,” played at the Thessaloniki Film Festival in 2022.
“If we want to have a thriving and ambitious Greek cinema, this has to be supported in a significantly more substantial way.”
The Visibility Zero movement was launched in June with an open letter to the Greek government demanding action over the critical state of domestic production.
Sending what it described as a “distress signal” to the Greek culture ministry and Creative Greece, the body created last year to oversee the country’s screen industries, the letter — which attracted more than 2,000 signatories — called for an increase in funding for the country’s audiovisual sector, a concerted effort to clear the backlog of delayed payments from Greece’s cash rebate system and an overhaul of the Creative Greece board to include seasoned industry professionals.
The movement, which takes its name from the 1970 drama by Greek filmmaker Nikos Foskolos, quickly attracted support from nearly 200 international film luminaries, including Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Vicky Krieps, Charlie Kaufman, Ruben Östlund, Radu Jude and Paweł Pawlikowski, who signed a statement “in solidarity with [Greek] filmmakers’ demands for greater support” from their government.
“Attacks on cinema and the arts, whether through action or inaction, are unacceptable,” the statement read. “We remain steadfast in our support of our colleagues in Greece and hope that the artists of one of Europe’s most vibrant and dynamic film industries will soon be operating within a framework that is both appropriate and worthy of their work.”
This week in Thessaloniki, industry professionals have been circulating leaflets and Visibility Zero campaign buttons, hoping to raise awareness about their struggle by ensuring that the movement is anything but invisible to festival guests.
“[Thessaloniki] is our biggest national film event. It is important for the audience to understand that we are making these [films] that they come and see at the festival with [little] means,” said veteran film producer Vicky Miha (“Dogtooth,” “Quiet Life”). Given the current circumstances, she added, “how can we move toward a better future for Greek cinema?”
In response to questions posed by Variety , a representative for Creative Greece (known by its Greek acronym, EKKOMED) insisted that the body “has now entered a stable and mature phase of operation” after a shaky transition period following the organization’s 2017 launch and is focused on a five-year action plan to support the “long-term development of Greek cinema.”
Regarding the backlog of unpaid rebate claims, the rep noted that of the €234 million ($271 million) disbursed by the Greek government since 2019 to support the audiovisual sector through both its cash rebate and selective funding schemes, €88.5 million ($102 million), or 37.8% of the total, has been paid out since Sept. 2024, when EKKOMED was formally established.
In addition, last year, in response to industry demands, EKKOMED raised the budget of its selective funding scheme, with this year’s allocation of €6.5 million ($7.5 million) “marking the highest budget ever for selective programs — an almost 55% increase compared to previous years,” the rep said.
However, Greek filmmakers insist that still falls short of the €15 million ($17.4 million) pledged to the industry by Greek officials in November 2023, and that the increase has done little to close the gap with neighboring countries. The crop of local productions screening this week in Thessaloniki — which includes 32 feature-length and 30 short films, among them 29 premieres — is a byproduct of the industry’s “resilience,” according to Miha, rather than a sign of adequate government support.
Despite their frustration, Greek filmmakers acknowledge the great strides their industry has taken since the cash rebate was introduced in 2019. And they say the efforts of the Visibility Zero movement have sparked a productive dialogue between industry stakeholders and the government that they hope will bear fruit in the months ahead.
“The Greek film industry has changed so much in the past 8 years,” said Miha. “There is progress with the institutions. There’s still a lot of work to be done on many levels, but the goal of everybody is to work together for a stronger Greek cinema.”
The Thessaloniki Film Festival runs Oct. 30 – Nov. 9.

Back in 2022, former Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving sparked an uproar when he posted links to antisemitic tropes on social media . After the point guard initially refused to apologize, the Nets suspended him without pay. At the time, New York-based CNN global affairs analyst Bianna Golodryga wasn’t sure what to tell her then-tween son, who idolized the hometown hero and was confused about the rise in cultural figures including Kanye West sharing similar sentiments . Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“My son asked me, ‘Can I not go to games anymore? Do they not like us? Am I being excluded for being Jewish?’ And I decided to reach out to his school and ask about what resources they had to address antisemitism,” Golodryga recalls. “It was basically ‘Nothing for this age. We encourage them to ask questions themselves, and then once they ask them, maybe we can address it.’ Realistically, I can’t imagine a preteen asking questions like that in class. We just expected more.” Popular on Variety
As she scoured bookstores and libraries for helpful material, the mother of two found a yawning void for kids in the 8-12 age range. Given her backstory as a Soviet émigré and Emmy-winning journalist who anchors “One World” weekdays at 11 a.m. on CNN International, she had long been encouraged to write a memoir. Instead, she decided to tackle a kid lit novel that tweens like her son might find useful.
On Nov. 11, “Don’t Feed the Lion,” which Golodryga co-wrote with Israeli journalist Yonit Levi, hits shelves. The book, which is blurbed by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash , charts the ripple effects of a beloved soccer pro making an antisemitic comment that goes viral. For teen protagonist Theo Kaplan, those reverberations hit home when a swastika appears on a school locker, forcing him to speak up rather than remain silent.
A year after Irving’s suspension, Golodryga and Levi began writing “Don’t Feed the Lion” following the Oct. 7 terror attacks in southern Israel, which triggered “a spike in antisemitism that I think a lot of us sadly anticipated,” says the CNN anchor, who has reported extensively on the Israel-Gaza conflict. The collaboration gave the two women, who first met while covering the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a chance to process a difficult landscape.
“It was a very ambitious goal and idea, and at the very least, we thought, ‘We get to spend time together, at least virtually. And if it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.’ It’s a fictional story, but it’s clearly art imitating life,” Golodryga recalls. “And it came together rather quickly.”
Her agents at CAA loved the pitch and early chapters and began submitting the project to publishers. Every literary house rejected it. Some passed on the grounds that middle grade fiction is a tough sell, unlike YA for older teens. Others gave vague feedback about the timing not being right.
“We got a number of rejections. I’ll just leave it there,” Golodryga says. “But we were so driven to do this project, and we said, ‘Worst case, we’ll just self-publish.’”
Enter Michael Lynton , the former Sony Pictures Entertainment chief and current Snap chairman, who first met Levi, a mother of three, through “Homeland” producer Howard Gordon . Not long after, he sat next to Golodryga at an event, and she talked about the uphill battle she faced in getting a publisher to bite. It turns out the tech mogul had a side hustle as co-owner of a boutique publishing house. In 2018, Lynton, his sister and brother-in-law and a group of investors acquired Arcadia Publishing, best known for its sepia-colored local history books found at every pharmacy and bookstore in America. He asked Golodryga to send him the manuscript.
“We just said, ‘This is great. Let’s go.’ It was extremely straightforward and immediate,” Lynton remembers.
In today’s hyperpolarized world, some may consider “Don’t Feed the Lion” divisive merely because Levi is Israeli. After all, celebrities and industryites have signed various open letters over the past two years calling for boycotts of Israeli creatives. Lynton doesn’t know if the book will be seen as controversial.
“Let’s find out,” he says. “I’m perfectly willing to take that on for a cause like this. This is something that should be in schools and young people should be reading and parents should have available to them.”

Bob Iger is getting ready for his encore farewell.
The Disney CEO is starting to lay the stepping stones to the expected news of plans for a regime change at the top of the Mouse House by the first quarter of next year. In October 2024, Disney’s board of directors vowed to spell out its succession plan for Iger , who will have held the top job for 20 years by the time his current contract ends in December 2026. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Iger reflected on his time at the Disney in an interview with British podcasters Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook, hosts of the long-running podcast series “The Rest Is History.” The pair turned their focus to the creation of Disneyland in the mid-1950s for an installment published Wednesday. Iger has long been a fan of the podcast and agreed to give the hosts a sit-down interview, as well as a guided tour of Disney’s archives in Burbank and the Magic Kingdom in Anaheim. Popular on Variety
Holland and Sandbrook politely but firmly press Iger about the transition that is just around the corner. Iger stepped down as CEO of Disney after a 15-year run that made him the gold standard of media and entertainment executives. He left Disney entirely at the end of 2021. But Iger was back as CEO by November 2022 after his first successor, studio veteran Bob Chapek, had a rocky tenure at a volatile time for the economy and the nation overall. At present, industry speculation about Iger’s successor centers on two internal candidates, Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden and Disney Experiences chair Josh D’Amaro.
Iger made no direct reference to the Chapek shuffle or the handoff to come in discussing how he views his legacy, and what he has learned after four decades at the Walt Disney Co. and more than 50 years in the entertainment biz. Holland and Sandbrook pressed Iger about how he wanted to be remembered for his tenure as Mouse House chief.
“Because of the company’s place in the world, I think the person running the company has a special responsibility of sorts, to maintain Disney’s position in the world as a beloved company, as an admired company, as a company that entertains really the world, everyone of all ages and from all different walks of life,” Iger says in the episode “Disneyland: The Modern American Utopia.”
“More than anything else, I would want to be known as someone who was given the keys to this kingdom, so to speak. And quite a kingdom it is, and that I brought it to a place that even Walt would be proud of. And what that means is more great storytelling to a larger audience, more innovation, more risk-taking, more really creation of happiness. It’s really that simple,” Iger says. “At one point I thought, Well, OK, you’re now running Disney. What’s the most you want out of it? Well, not don’t screw it up, but it’s much more than that. I really have been mindful of the duty that I feel has been handed to me to make it even better than it’s ever been.”
What does the road to the next 50 years of Disney, which marked its centennial in 2023, look like for his successor? Protect the brand, Iger advises.
“The world is changing so rapidly and in such profound ways. As I think about the future, I would hope that my successors would be respectful of our past and well aware of the values that really created the value of the company in the first place, and carry them forward, but not let anything that’s been done in the past get in the way of bringing the company into the future,” Iger says. “And that’s really constant innovation, a constant exploration, constant desire to reinvent or to invent even more than anything else. That’s what I’d want. But I think we do occupy a place in the world as great storytellers, perhaps maybe the greatest in many respects. And I would hope that position would would continue for years and years, decades ahead.”
Most of the interview was devoted to discussion of the innovations of Walt Disney himself, the creative visionary who died in 1966 at age 65. Iger proved to be a fount of knowledge about the company’s founder. His reverence for Walt Disney’s legacy of business derring-do coupled with a relentless push for innovation is clear as he runs through Walt Disney’s list of awe-inspiring achievements.
The yearning to invest in cutting-edge technology, R&D and experimental material is imbued in the DNA of a artist and entrepreneur from Missouri who bet his company on the gamble of releasing Hollywood’s first feature-length animated feature, 1937’s “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
“If you ask what everything is going to cost before you make everything, or even think about making something, then you end up not making a lot that you should have made,” Iger opines.
Walt Disney was never one to be “cowed” by new technology, Iger added. Quite the contrary. He famously turned to the burgeoning medium of television to help raise the money to build Disneyland. Call it TV’s first docu-series.
“Walt was, as we know, not only a great storyteller, but one of the all-time great salesmen of his time, and he decided that not only to raise the money, but also to sell the product, he should have a television program. So he licensed to ABC, a program that essentially told the story of building Disneyland,” Iger says. “And so here I was as a 3-4-5 year-old, watching on small, black-and-white TV, Walt not only talk about building Disneyland, but watching it on the program actually rise from the ground in Orange County, California. And I remember it being incredibly aspirational. And I think actually it served that purpose to hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people around the world seeing it, which seemed like something that never existed before, a form of entertainment that he really invented.”
The hosts pressed Iger on how Disney is grappling with the the globalization of media and culture in a brand that is synonymous with Americana past and present.
“It’s not purposeful on our part to become less American. It is purposeful on our part, to become more inviting to the world and to be mindful of cultural distinctions and cultural passion. For instance, when we were building Shanghai, the design brief that I gave to the team was, let’s build something that is authentically Disney, but distinctly Chinese,” Iger says.
“Because we wanted to build something that was very much Disney to them, and they had an idea in mind of what a Disneyland would be, but something that was extremely respectful of their own culture, so that they could feel as though it were theirs. Again, it’s more purposeful to fit in a respectful way than to distance ourselves from anything like letting the French drink wine,” he says. “I think there were learnings about entering a country and a culture with a little bit more sensitivity and respect. We took those learnings seriously, and as we designed Shanghai, we made sure that we didn’t make mistakes that had been made in the past.”

The wild ride that is Peacock’s “All Her Fault” stars Sarah Snook and Jake Lacy as Marissa and Peter Irvine, ultra-wealthy Chicago parents of 5-year-old Milo (Duke McCloud) driven to the edge when he’s kidnapped. That Milo’s kidnapper is Carrie (Sophia Lillis), the nanny of another couple at their private school, sets off a series of events that, by the end of “All Her Fault,” have completely unraveled the Irvines’ lives. To say the least! In the finale of the limited series — created by Megan Gallagher, from Andrea Mara’s 2021 novel of the same name — Marissa has murdered (yes, murdered!) Peter in order to protect herself and Milo.
“All Her Fault” is Snook’s first television role since she won the drama lead actress Emmy for the final season of “Succession,” and since winning both an Olivier and a Tony award for the feat of playing all 26 characters in “The Picture of Dorian Gray” on stage. (She filmed “All Her Fault” in Melbourne, Australia, her home base, in between the play’s first run on the West End and its move Broadway last spring.) As an executive producer on the show, as well as its star, Snook tells Variety that she was attracted to “All Her Fault” because she’d “never done a thriller — I’ve never really dived into this world.” The character, who is under duress from the show’s first minute, also posed an acting challenge, she says, because she “wanted to see what it’s like to live inside a harrowing moment.”
“Also, I read the book,” Snook says. “And it’s got a plot twist that just couldn’t say no to, you know?” That’s actually plot twists , plural. With its cliffhanger endings, and gasp-inducing reveals, “All Her Fault” joins recent thrillers such as “The Hunting Wives,” “Paradise” and “Presumed Innocent” as chaotic new entries in the 2.0 version of OMG TV.
A synopsis: the blast radius from Milo’s kidnapping causes chaos among the Irvines, specifically with Peter’s siblings, Lia (Abby Elliott) and Brian (Daniel Monks). Their family mythology — an insidious fiction of Peter’s, as it turns out — is that, during their early childhood, Lia had caused an accident that’s left Brian disabled and in chronic pain. The fallout changed all of their lives: A guilt-ridden Lia has continuously struggled with addiction, Brian is depressed and has no self-worth — and both of them rely on Peter for their livelihoods. But then, in the show’s sixth episode, Peter finally confesses that he was the one who had tripped Brian when they were kids. This revelation is significant, because it shows Marissa that Peter is willing to lie about just about anything.
Including the fact that Milo isn’t their biological son! Which Marissa discovers in the most batshit possible way. Five years earlier, during their drive home from the hospital after Milo’s birth, Peter and Marissa were in a horrific car wreck with another car, driven by a young mother named Josie (Carrie’s real name) and carrying her infant son, both of whom survived the accident. In the finale, Peter admits to Marissa, who had been knocked unconscious in the crash, that he had switched Josie’s living baby with their newborn who’d been killed.
Years later, Carrie figured this out after meeting Milo, immediately establishing a connection with him and realizing that he too has synesthesia (long story!). Yes, it’s a stretch, but the mentally unstable Carrie is in fact correct, and, after becoming fixated on the idea that her baby had lived through the crash, poses as a nanny for Jenny (Dakota Fanning) — a parent at Milo’s school — so she can infiltrate Milo’s life.
But before Carrie can expose Peter to Marissa as the villain he really is — that is, not only a baby-snatcher himself, but a killer who’d also bludgeoned Carrie’s father (and fellow kidnapper) to death — Peter shoots Carrie in their living room. Milo had just been “found,” because Peter had taken him from the motel room where Carrie and her dad were keeping him, leaving the child in a car to be turned into a police station. Carrie’s dad had recorded his interaction with Peter (including the murder!); rather than let Carrie play the recording, Peter silences her at any cost. Marissa does listen afterward, but what’s she to do? Peter is right that the police will take Milo away, should Marissa tell them what he’s done.
So as you can see, Marissa is really in a bind. But the Chekhov’s gun of “All Her Fault” is Peter’s deadly allergy to soy. After subbing out his EpiPen with an expired one, and getting rid of the First Aid kit in their car, Marissa she deliberately kisses him …. after just eating soy-filled food. And then she watches him intently as he goes into anaphylaxis — at first seeming like she wants to help, and then revealing her clear purpose. And Detective Alcaraz (Michael Peña) even figures it out eventually, but because he’s done some morally questionable things for the sake of his own son, he tells Marissa he won’t come after her for murdering Peter.
Whew! Right? In its final moments, “All Her Fault” deliberately gives the finger to its title, and ends with the pleasingly matriarchal image of Marissa and Jenny (who’s also gotten rid of her husband, though not via crimes) drinking wine and looking lovingly at their two sons playing together.
In an interview this week, Snook talks about choosing the role of Marissa, what the show’s final shot means to her and what the most recent message on the “ Succession ” group chat is.

“Succession” is a career-defining highlight that I really have had to work hard to put into a separate category — it’s not something that can be repeated. There’s no trying to find projects that are going to be like “ Succession” — “Succession” is its own thing, and I’d like to keep it that way! Popular on Variety
But I’d never done a thriller. I’ve never really dived into this world. They’re a popular genre at the moment, and I wanted to see what it’s like to live inside a harrowing moment. Like, what is the sustainability of doing that as an actor? Also, I read the book, and it’s got a plot twist that just couldn’t say no to, you know?
I respectfully let Megan take the lead on that, obviously, and she’s such a brilliant writer, and had really expanded the universe of what the book offers. There’s the novel that explores it in different ways, and it’s set in Dublin — and then we’ve got the series that is set in Chicago and really goes into different worlds.
Changing the ending in the ways that we did — obviously, the major part isn’t changed as much. But having Marissa have that last say was really important to wrapping up our story.
Exactly! How do you begin? It felt very Greek tragedy to me. It felt very much like these are gods and deities fooling around with human lives, and making bad decisions. Marissa definitely had to have the last word, I think. In the book, it’s a quiet final moment — an allusion to Peter dying via poisoning. But here, it’s much more activated for Marissa to take back the control of her own narrative.
And dealing with the revelation that Milo isn’t her son — if it was real life, you receive that information, and it doesn’t all sink in in that one moment. There’s going to be something beyond Episode 8 and the show’s final moments: The revelations will still continue to sink in, and the shock will still continue to ricochet for Marissa and for Milo. Fortunately, she has the friendship of Jenny to find strength from.
Yeah, I mean, that’s part of the reason I said yes, and I wanted to be a part of the project as well. Shiv was such a restrained and repressed character emotionally. She had short outbursts of rage and other kind of bites. And also, her maternal instincts — who knows?
Whereas Marissa definitely, confidently, wants to be a mum. Always has wanted to be a mum! Always wanted to have that close family life. It’s something that she didn’t have growing up. We hear a little bit about her history. But she’s got a sort of small life with her husband, her brother-and-sister-in-law and her kid. And that’s what she likes . It’s cozy. And to have it all sort of blown up is — that’s a challenge coming in as an actor to think, “OK, we’re gonna have to sustain this for how long?” But it’s also a rewarding challenge.
Yeah, there’s a moment in the scene with Jenny. It’s one of those things where you kind of go, “OK, now there’s no turning back.” So the “now there’s no turning back” is the moment she’s just kissed him, I think. There’s turning back up until the deed is done.
I think she knows intuitively that she can’t have this revolting human being around her anymore, and have any kind of influence over her son. Imagine the custody battle with that man! So she knows that he has to go. He just has to go. And he deserves to.
But what does the future hold for Marissa if that truth ever comes to light? Which is why I really loved that scene with Detective Alcaraz, where he sort of infers that, yes, he knows everything, and yet still has the grace to tell her that he knows everything — and also to stand back and say, but I’m gonna let it go.
It’s amazing. I mean, acting is always reacting and listening, and so there may not be actual lines, but there’s all sorts of things going on in her head. Listening to these revelations and calculating, “OK, am I safe? Am I not? Is this good for me? Is this bad for me?” And just getting to watch Michael Peña act is great.
It’s a really complex scene to approach, because you don’t want to lean into melodrama or histrionic kind of, like, “Die!” — like throwing the eyebrows up and eyeballs down. There’s just so much release going on, and it’s a very complex, very difficult scene to play. And hopefully we got the tone right, but it was one I was worried about.
Yeah, absolutely.
Probably in the edit there were times when in enacting it, there’s indications earlier. But it’s better for tension to leave it right to the last minute, because you want to know, “Is he gonna die knowing? Is he gonna die not knowing?” There’s much more tension in that. I think.
You have to be able to breathe out with a story like this. You’ve got to be able to go, [ exhales], “Oh, OK.” Like, everything’s probably gonna be OK. You have to find, what’s the rainbow here? And the risk is to make something too shiny and too wrapped up and too like, “Aha! Now the two friends can be friends forever, and what’s gonna happen next?”
So we had to try and strike a balance between too shiny and also realistic. But realistically, what Marissa and Jenny really found in their friendship was that it was the strongest bond in their lives. So for me, it totally made sense: I’m gonna move as close as I can to create a community, to really, to really start again in the way that I’m in control of my own narrative.
It’s crazy. I mean, for a little while, just deal with the whiplash of all those revelations. I think at some point Milo is going to have to know or find out, or he’s going to cotton onto something, and she has to support him in the dealing of grief of losing his father. He’s gotta get over all the trauma of being away from us, and being kidnapped. But then also, he’s going to deal with the grief of losing his father as a 5-year-old. And the difficulty for Marissa to uphold which memory: The memory of this amazing dad, the one that Milo remembers? Or the real truth of who Peter really was. And that’s going to be difficult for Marissa.
Only in the sense of like that they’re wealthy characters. I think Shiv is in a different category. She’s in this astronomical wealth elite, whereas Marissa is more socially wealthy and you might meet her on the street. You wouldn’t meet Shiv on the street.
I think Marissa is more of a reflection of myself, maybe — much more personable, warm. Whereas Shiv is much more of a cold-hearted bitch. She’s a different kind of stern character.
I think she sees a comrade, a compatriot. In the shooting of the scene in the bathroom — where they turn up in the same dress — we had to make sure that that was a really believable rapport-building, grounding, beginning of a friendship. That you go, “I really like that person.”
Some people just have chemistry, and you can’t fake it; Marissa and Jenny, they have chemistry. They go well together. And this is a kind of circumstance that, unfortunately, has thrown them together. But they found real strength and empowerment from each other. And yeah, it is a risk to let her know what her plans are regarding Peter. But in some ways, you kind of have just got to offload, and share it with somebody . Maybe that’s the takeaway — keeping secrets to yourself is often doomed to fail.
I think Jesse Armstrong, the creator, put it really well, when he said at one point, “I don’t really believe that people can change. They’re always going to be who they are, inevitably.” There’s an inevitability, I think, about people. And there’s something about that with Shiv, like she probably is still second next to Tom. In some ways, still in charge, and in some ways scratching, scrapping, reaching for — but always just missing out. And that’ll always be the source of great frustration and annoyance for her.
Let me find out! I’ll see if I can say it — one second [ looks at phone ]. It’s been active recently, because they all came to the show, and I sent them a smiley face with love hearts and a celebratory-like emoji. But Dag wrote, “Can’t wait to see you later, Sarah!” And Fisher [Stevens] was like, “Good luck! Wish I could be there, but not in New York.”
Yes! Although I don’t know if you could ever really describe this character — and what Marissa goes through — as a relief . But a different kind of compartmentalizing going on, yeah.
Don’t know yet! Other than that, at the end of this press tour, I am unemployed. [cackles] And I’m quite happy about it.

By Todd Spangler
NY Digital Editor
Sinclair , one of the U.S.’s biggest TV station groups, saw a significant drop in revenue and swung to a net loss for the third quarter of 2025.
For Q3, the company reported revenue of $773 million, down 16%, and a net loss of $1 million (or 2 cents per share) compared with net income of $94 million in the year-earlier period.
On the earnings call, Sinclair president and CEO Chris Ripley noted that Sinclair’s ABC stations are currently affected by the Disney-YouTube TV dispute, which has resulted in a blackout of ABC, as well as ESPN and other networks, on YouTube TV since last Friday. Sinclair has 38 ABC affiliates. He blasted both both Google and Disney for the situation, calling them “media giants,” and said local broadcasters are “caught in the middle” of such disputes — which he labeled an “antitrust issue.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Ripley said the company is lobbying for changes so that local TV station owners have control over such pay-TV distribution deals. “As local broadcasters, we have no say in whether our content — and the content we pay to air — will be distributed to local viewers,” Ripley said, adding that Sinclair and others have discussed the issue with the FCC and antitrust regulators. “We believe this practice needs to be stopped.” Popular on Variety
The Disney-YouTube TV blackout and others like it “continue to hurt local viewers and local journalism,” Ripley said.
Sinclair’s earnings report came after its ABC-affiliated stations had briefly preempted “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in September over the TV host’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s killer. It’s not clear the extent to which the Kimmel boycott affected Sinclair’s financial results for the quarter; the company did not provide any discussion of the blackout in its earnings press release and the topic did not come up on the call with analysts.
Sinclair’s Q3 advertising revenue was particularly hard-hit, dropping 26% year over year to $321 million, attributable to much lower political ad sales ($6 million) compared with a record $138 million in the third quarter of 2024 during last year’s presidential election cycle. Media segment revenue was $765 million for the quarter, down 16%; that segment consists primarily of broadcast TV stations and includes multicast networks and original content.
“Sinclair delivered a strong third quarter, achieving the high end of guidance for advertising and distribution revenue, while media expenses and adjusted EBITDA beat expectations,” Ripley said in prepared remarks. “We expect to see continued improvement in core advertising trends in the fourth quarter and a sequential increase in distribution revenue.”
Baltimore-based Sinclair owns, operates and/or provides services to 185 TV stations in 85 markets affiliated with each of the major broadcast networks. It also owns Tennis Channel and multicast networks Comet, Charge!, TBD and The Nest.
Sinclair, known for its conservative political leanings, on Sept. 17 said it was pulling “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from its ABC stations over what Kimmel said on his show two days earlier: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize the kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” MAGA supporters were outraged, interpreting that as Kimmel saying Kirk’s assassin was “one of them.” FCC chairman Brendan Carr weighed in on the situation; speaking earlier on Sept. 17 on a conservative podcast, he strongly implied ABC affiliates would be targeted by the agency and their spectrum licenses revoked if they didn’t “take action” on Kimmel (i.e., pull the show off the air). Following  Carr’s threat and the pressure from Sinclair and Nexstar Media — which also announced it would preempt Kimmel — ABC said it was suspending “ Jimmy Kimmel Live!” indefinitely.
In August, Sinclair had announced a “comprehensive strategic review” for its broadcast business, including potential sales and acquisitions . Any deal Sinclair engages in that would involve the transfer of broadcast licenses would be subject to FCC review and approval. On the earnings call, Ripley said Sinclair expects the FCC to raise — or eliminate — the 39% national ownership cap on TV station ownership in the first half of 2026. He also noted that the FCC’s rule barring a station group from owning more than one of the top four TV stations in a given market was recently vacated.
As of Nov. 1, Sinclair had closed on 11 partner station acquisitions with “additional deals pending FCC approval, and more transactions planned,” according to Ripley. The acquisitions represent at least $30 million in incremental annualized EBITDA once finalized, he added. In 2026, “we anticipate record midterm political revenue in the upcoming cycle, and are encouraged by recent regulatory developments that should lead to much-needed industry consolidation and significant synergies for investors,” Ripley said.
Sinclair claimed its decision to preempt Kimmel’s show “was independent of any government interaction or influence” (as did Nexstar). In its Sept. 17 statement, Sinclair said, “We appreciate FCC Chairman Carr’s remarks today and this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks.”
Sinclair previously said that before it would consider returning “Kimmel” to its ABC affiliates, the TV host must apologize to Kirk’s family and send “a meaningful personal donation” to them as well as Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk founded. (Sinclair planned to run a Charlie Kirk tribute on its ABC affiliates on Sept. 19 but instead aired a rerun of “Celebrity Family Feud.” )
Kimmel has not specifically apologized to the Kirk family or offered a donation to Turning Point USA. Following ABC’s decision to resume “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on Sept. 23, Sinclair said its ABC stations would resume airing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” as of Sept. 26 after “ongoing and constructive discussions with ABC” about various measures, including the possible appointment of a network-wide independent ombudsman. Sinclair also defended its move to preempt Kimmel, saying “it is simply inconsistent to champion free speech while demanding that broadcasters air specific content.”
Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk, said in an interview this week with Fox News’ Jesse Watters that Sinclair execs reached out to her to ask if she wanted Sinclair to try to elicit an apology from Kimmel or if she wanted to appear on “a show.” According to Erika Kirk, she declined Sinclair’s offers.
Kimmel, in an emotional monologue on his first night back on the air after ABC’s suspension, said, “It was never my intention to make light of the murder of a young man. I don’t think there’s anything funny about it.” He added, “I posted a message on Instagram on the day he was killed, sending love to his family and asking for compassion, and I meant it. And I still do.”

NY Digital Editor
Meta , the parent of Facebook, Instagram and more, saw its top-line revenue jump 26% to a whopping $51.2 billion in the third quarter — a new quarterly record. But a provision of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act led to a huge tax charge, causing the internet giant to fall well short of Wall Street expectations.
The implementation of the U.S.’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act led to “the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax,” Meta said in announcing Q3 results. As a result, its earnings for the quarter included a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Meta also said, “We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Popular on Variety
The company’s net income for Q3 was $2.71 billion — down 83% on the tax charge — translating to earnings of $1.05 per share. (Analysts consensus estimates had pegged EPS of $6.69.) Excluding the one-time tax charge, Meta’s diluted EPS would have been $7.25, according to the company.
For the month of September, the average daily active users across Meta’s family of apps (including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Threads) was 3.54 billion, up 8% year-over-year.
“We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in announcing the results. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses. If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.”
Meta’s Reality Labs segment, which includes the Quest headset and its other VR and augmented-reality businesses, continued to lose billions. Q3 revenue for Reality Labs was $470 million (vs. $270 million in the year-prior period), while operating loss was $4.43 billion (roughly flat).
The company ended the quarter with $44.45 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Meta’s headcount was 78,450 employees as of Sept. 30, up 8% year-over-year.
Meta said it anticipates Q4 total revenue to be $56 billion-$59 billion and full-year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be $70 billion-$72 billion (up from the prior outlook of $66 billion-$72 billion). The company said it expects capital spending “will be notably larger” in 2026 than 2025, as it looks to add more computing infrastructure for AI than it previously anticipated.

By Ben Croll
France’s vibrant VFX sector now stands at the forefront of the country’s broader push to strengthen its global production appeal, reflecting a national strategy that has championed the craft ever since the 2020 revision of the Tax Rebate for International Production (TRIP).
That update introduced a 10% bonus on all eligible expenses for productions spending over $2.3 million with local VFX houses. Five years on, the incentive has proven transformative, driving studio expansion, nurturing talent and attracting a steady stream of high-profile international projects to French soil. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Today, the sector has reached maturity — and with maturity comes resilience. The unexpected collapse of Technicolor triggered layoffs and production disruptions, while a broader post-pandemic slowdown has seen commissions drop nearly 30%. With AI disruption and studio consolidation looming, growth increasingly depends on adaptability. Popular on Variety
“Flexibility, agility and teamwork define the new business model,” says the Yard founder and CEO Laurens Ehrmann. “Our midsize structure offers a real advantage. Clients know their projects matter, that they’ll get an A-team, and that we’ll always respond quickly.”
With outposts in Paris, Montpellier and now London — a move to access multiple tax credits while staying close to partners like Amazon and Netflix — the Yard has tied its expansion directly to relationship management.
Case in point: after working on 2019’s “Ford v Ferrari,” the Yard maintained strong ties with the project’s VFX supervisor, who later entrusted them with advanced creature work on this year’s “ Predator: Badlands .” Tasked with a milestone sequence, the studio built an animation, character, creature and digidouble pipeline from scratch, handling 120 complex shots and creating a robust toolset for future creature FX.
“Working on creatures is one of the most complex parts of VFX,” Ehrmann explains. “Mastering it allows you to bid on entire sequences with vast environments and complex characters, now positioning us as a tier-one VFX company.”
Executives from VFX studio One of Us describe their work on 2024’s “Damsel” as similarly transformative. The studio delivered over 400 shots, including 250 featuring a fully realized, emotive dragon, with the rest dedicated to large-scale destruction and fully 3D environments. Splitting the work between outposts in London and Paris, the studio’s teams collaborated seamlessly, emerging from this trial-by-fire with cost-saving insights.
“Getting involved early is critical,” says Emmanuel Pichereau, CCO of One of Us. “It allows us to plan strategically, reduce shot counts, control costs and, most importantly, align with the film’s storytelling from the very beginning when changes are still flexible.”
The studio is applying this philosophy to upcoming projects like “The Bride!” and “Peaky Blinders: The Immortal Man.” For both, the team is working from its Paris office to qualify for the full French tax rebate, crafting visual effects designed to be seamless rather than showy.
“We want to blend into these worlds,” says CEO Rachael Penfold. “We’re there to serve the story and realize the filmmakers’ vision, not to show off. The best visual effect is often the one you never notice.”
But Penfold is happy to tout the French value proposition — and she recently traveled to Los Angeles to championed Gallic talent at industry sessions and case studies.
“The French film industry is mature, and its talent is often immersed in a culture of great filmmaking, not just trained on specific software,” Penfold says. “The emphasis is cultural — it’s about artistic problem-solving and craftsmanship. While some focus on technical details, French artists tend to take a more holistic, well-rounded view. That mindset brings added value to every project.”

Variety Editor at Large
The Paley Center for Media ‘s New York headquarters, the Paley Museum , is kicking off its 50th anniversary this week by unveiling a makeover — including two newly renovated theaters, a new exhibition and gathering area and more.
The Paley Museum, located in midtown Manhattan, was first created in 1975 by CBS founder William S. Paley as the Museum of Broadcasting, and then later as the Museum of TV & Radio. (The name was changed to the Paley Center in 2007). The museum later added a second building on the west coast in Beverly Hills (which opened in 1996 and closed in 2020).

“For five decades, Paley has stood at the intersection of media, culture, and education, serving as a trusted resource for public audiences and educators alike. Recognized as the premier gathering place for the industry – presenting programs with unmatched convening power – Paley has evolved to its place as the preeminent media industry nonprofit,,” said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., executive vice chairman and former CEO of Hearst, and chairman of the Paley Center since 1991. Popular on Variety
The Paley Museum continues to host events like the annual PaleyFest NY, as well as the annual holiday family event Paleyland, and the Paley archive, which features unique and rare video and audio programs.
The updates to Paley Museum (which was designed by Philip Johnson) were overseen by the Paley board’s renovation committee, which included Frank A. Bennack, Jr., Mark Lazarus, William C. Paley, Maureen Reidy, David Schoer, Somyanarayan Sampath, Jennifer Witz and Strauss Zelnick, along with Tom Gallagher of DLR Group.
“The Paley Museum has proudly called New York City home for fifty years. Building on its storied legacy, it has become the destination where media, sports, gaming, and entertainment come together — offering blockbuster exhibits, interactive experiences, and once-in-a-lifetime events,” said Reidy, who serves as president and CEO of The Paley Center for Media. “With the unveiling of our newly renovated theaters and galleries, we extend our deepest gratitude to our generous donors — including the William S. Paley Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, and The Hearst Foundations — for making these new spaces possible.”
Among the changes: Two newly renovated theaters, including the 200-seat Bennack Theater and the George J. Gillespie, III Theater on the museum’s second floor. According to Paley, the theaters now include “new seating, plush carpeting, rich wood paneling, and refined finishes, complemented by state-of-the-art Dolby Atmos surround sound, advanced lighting design, and the latest in cutting-edge technology.”
The renamed George J. Gillespie, III Theater, sponsored by William S. Paley Foundation, honors a attorney, philanthropist and leader who served nearly three decades on the Paley Board and the Paley Foundation Board.
“It is an honor to support The Paley Center for Media on the occasion of this milestone anniversary,” said the William S. Paley Foundation’s William C. Paley. “I believe my father would be very proud to see how Paley has grown from his original vision to the iconic destination that it has become today.”
Also new: the Bloomberg Gallery on the concourse level, via Bloomberg Philanthropies, which features a digital display wall and will feature immersive exhibits, as well as serve as a venue for receptions and events. The Paley Museum will also be featured on the Bloomberg Connects app starting Nov. 5.
“The Paley Museum has helped document and share the incredible story of media’s evolution, from radio and television to the internet and social media and beyond,” said Bloomberg founder and former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. “We are glad to help the Museum mark its 50th anniversary by joining with it to open the new Bloomberg Gallery and launch Bloomberg Connects, and we look forward to seeing how the Museum continues to evolve as a hub for learning and leadership.”
And then, the entrance to the Bennack Theater has been named the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Entrance.
“As a nexus not only of media, but also of sports, politics, and entertainment, The Paley Museum offers us all the chance to better understand the cultural forces flowing through our lives,” said Stavros Niarchos Foundation co-president Andreas Dracopoulos. “We at SNF feel a strong resonance with our own work to broaden access to arts and culture, journalism and trusted information, always keeping humanity at the core.”
An upcoming second phase of the renovations will include content creation and podcast studios, as well as a new recording studio and television studio.
Starting Friday, Nov. 7 through Nov. 16, this year’s PaleyFest NY November 7-16, includes conversations with country singer Trisha Yearwood, two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, and the casts and creative teams from series “Pluribus,” “Landman,” “Power Book IV: Force” and “A Man on the Inside.”
The Paley Museum will host conversations with sportscaster Bob Costas on Dec. 9; next year, Paley Museum displays will include an event themed to the 50th season of “Survivor.” The venue will also hold a Super Bowl watch party, a new artist and songwriter series and more.

By Clayton Davis
Senior Awards Editor
Laura Dern is fearless, from her breakthrough in David Lynch’s “Wild at Heart” to her Oscar-winning turn in “Marriage Story.”
But as the Variety Awards Circuit Pdocast met with the star to discuss her latest work — two radically different films arriving this fall — the actress seems more interested in talking about purpose than performance, and more concerned with showing up for what matters than chasing the next accolade.

“I feel really privileged to be talking to you about two movies at this time that are about empathy and kindness and not missing your life and not being caught up by ambition or disregard for what matters to you in totally, radically different ways,” Dern reflects, acknowledging the weight of discussing art during troubling times. “The movies are both speaking to that.” Popular on Variety
The films in question couldn’t be more tonally distinct. Noah Baumbach’s “ Jay Kelly ,” starring George Clooney, uses the iconography of Hollywood stardom to deliver a universal message about presence and priorities. Bradley Cooper’s “ Is This Thing On ,” featuring Will Arnett and a surprising turn from NFL legend Peyton Manning, explores the aftermath of a breakup with raw honesty and unexpected humor. What unites them is Dern’s ability to find the humanity in characters navigating life’s most complicated terrain.
Variety Awards Circuit: Oscars
For Dern, these themes hit close to home. Raised by working actors Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, she understands intimately the sacrifices required by the profession. “The thing that always so upset me in my own childhood and then I’ve had to deal with my children, is you never get to plan anything, because you never know when you’re going to be asked to leave for three months to go to Budapest or New York or wherever it is,” she explains. The reckoning that “Jay Kelly” presents, she says, should resonate with anyone, regardless of profession: “Our goal is to show up for our loved ones and the people we care about, kind of at all cost.”
Her parents remain her greatest inspiration, not just as artists but as models of longevity. “Retirement has never been a word I understood or knew in my family,” Dern says, citing recent research on purpose-driven lives contributing to longevity. But she’s quick to point out a darker reality: “Heartbreakingly, for those who don’t know, in the acting profession, our unions, Screen Actors Guild, has no true health care plan for actors in retirement. So when you stop working, you lose your health care.”
When asked what she would change about the Academy Awards as the organization approaches its centennial, Dern’s answer reveals her values. Reflecting on last year’s emotional tribute to David Lynch, she says, “I felt such grief and such devotion amongst every single person in that room for what David Lynch meant to them, and I thought to myself, there has to be more time taken to pay tribute to the people who changed the craft forever.”
In “Is This Thing On,” which Cooper shot in just over 30 days operating the camera himself, Dern reunites with the intimate, raw filmmaking style that first drew her to acting. “I think it really holds the kind of storytelling and filmmaking that we all fell in love with when we were watching the movies of the 70s that made us want to do this,” she notes, praising both Cooper’s direction and Arnett’s “beautiful performance.”
As for the upcoming return to “Big Little Lies,” Dern is more than ready to reunite with her character, Renata Klein. “She’s truly endless bliss for an actor,” she says. “Even when you show up on set with an idea, she still shocks and surprises you — and that’s the greatest experience you can have.”
Dern compares the role to her breakout in Alexander Payne’s “Citizen Ruth,” calling both characters “so boundaryless you’re not sure where they’ll take you.” With Renata, she adds, “I don’t get to be in charge — she’s driving the ship. And I love that about her.” However, Dern is also candid it’s her time working with Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, and the rest of the stunning cast and filmmakers that makes the experience even sweeter: “To be with literally my best friends — oh my God, the greatest women ever. I feel so lucky.”
On this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast , she discusses her roles in Baumbach and Cooper’s films, reflects on a changing Hollywood, and what we can expect from her future roles.
NOTE: This episode was recorded 12 days prior to the passing of her mother Diane Ladd .
Also on this episode, Nina Hoss, one of the stars of Nia DaCosta’s “Hedda.” Listen below!
Read excerpts from his interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.
The world is radically troubling. And I feel in rarefied air to be here with you, getting to talk about movies, because we’re so privileged to have our jobs and to love them. But also, I don’t take it lightly that storytelling is a pretty extraordinary opportunity to talk about things that matter. In the most troubling of times when you feel that using voice for cause can be — and sometimes it is — the very most important thing, I feel really privileged to be talking to you about two movies at this time that are about empathy and kindness and not missing your life and not being caught up by ambition or disregard for what matters to you in totally, radically different ways. But the movies are both speaking to that. So with great good fortune, those are the movies that I’m getting to talk about right now.
I think I love how you describe the film, because I think Noah and Emily Mortimer, when they wrote the script, and Noah in his direction, clearly is speaking to the iconography of the movie star, and what we project onto the movie star and how our lives have sort of been narrated by the films and the music that are the background to our lives. For many of us, we’ve also placed both positively and negatively stereotypes or heartbreaks or longings onto the movie star. And truthfully, I think the film is a gift to all of us, using that language, using cinema as this backdrop to say, don’t miss your life.
I think for all of us, the ambition to first of all just make enough money to take care of a family, and if you’re blessed to do it with a vocation that you care a lot about or craft you care about, is its own dance. The sort of equity that’s put within industries on where you need to be at a given time to make sure you are the boss of the thing has really had misguidance in it for a lot of people who have to make really hard decisions. As a working actor raised by working actors, I think the thing that always so upset me in my own childhood and then I’ve had to deal with my children, is you never get to plan anything, because you never know when you’re going to be asked to leave for three months to go to Budapest or New York or wherever it is. The difference in my generation is we’ve been given the opportunity to take our children with us, or help us have support so there’s a place our kids can be, and a babysitter there with us. My mom, you couldn’t bring a kid. I mean, in summer, my mom figured out a way that I was with her, but it was a lot more sacrifice, even I think, for that generation.
Definitely watching this movie, my own childhood and my children’s childhood has been a reckoning of, you know, and I hope it is a reckoning for everyone who sees it, whatever their passion or profession, which just is that our goal is to show up for our loved ones and the people we care about, kind of at all cost. And it’s tough when work gets in the way. Painful.
I’m so moved in learning more about the longevity research, particularly that Dan Buettner has done on the Blue Zones globally. And the thing that we’ve now learned is the greatest path to longevity is purpose, and a purpose driven life and a service driven life. And my parents are working actors at 89 years old. Retirement has never been a word I understood or knew in my family. And they’re such amazing storytellers and they’re such radical characters. So they’re both doing amazing, and they inspire me every day to just keep going.
To be direct, because you and I go there about all things when we talk, heartbreakingly, for those who don’t know, in the acting profession, our unions, Screen Actors Guild, has no true health care plan for actors in retirement. So when you stop working, you lose your health care. So I also say that a lot of actors of my parents’ generation are desperately looking for two days on a TV show in their 80s, because they’ve got to work a certain amount of hours to continue to qualify for their health insurance.
Bradley is such a brilliant, truly brilliant filmmaker in terms of how he sees the movie he wants to make, even if we haven’t caught up to it yet. He saw it before he had it on the page, and then continued to develop it, invited me in. With Will and I working very intimately with Bradley on the dynamics of the relationship, to have them embedded in the story without having to be scripted, was so raw and cool and beautiful to me. I did see the dynamics of marriage that I’ve seen in other films, including “We Don’t Live Here Anymore” and “Marriage Story,” the question of breakup and divorce and children, and all the themes that we’ve seen in movies. But what this movie did that I thought was so brave was start us with a breakup where the audience and the protagonists of this breakup don’t know how we got here, and we don’t know what’s going to happen, and we just know it’s broken and we can’t fix it.
This question of giving ourselves the room to continually change — we’re living, breathing organisms that are ever changing, and how we think the day we marry someone that 20 years later it’s going to be the same person is nuts. The system is rigged. How we think that can be successful, instead of finding the room to evolve within yourself and bring that new identity into the marriage is hopefully the goal.
Imagine me at lunch or dinner breaks on that movie, sitting between the two of them—Peyton and Bradley—knowing little to nothing about football. I mean, I was raised by one of the biggest sports fans of all time, but in terms of being raised in LA predominantly on basketball and baseball. I didn’t really go to a lot of NFL games once the Rams left. But Bradley has taken me to a few Eagles games, and so I have had the privilege of being in that stadium and the obsession of fandom. I had not seen fandom like that in the US.
Listening to them talk about the game was incredible. You can know almost nothing about the NFL or the game of football, but you can know that Peyton Manning was the best there has ever been. And then you get to have this amazing experience. But no, Peyton was incredible. He’s such a good actor. Peyton was so generous, such an incredible guide to me about what it feels like for an athlete at that level. His knowledge of it and us trusting him as the greatest sets up a scene in such a great way that honestly, him being there and his ability as an actor kind of sets up Tess’s entire past history in a scene.
I was raised by actors and a godmother who’s an extraordinary actress, Shelley Winters. I was raised around the Academy Awards being the space where your peers acknowledge your storytelling, whatever craft you’re in. And there was a weighted-ness to it in my childhood. I understood that it was this really beautiful honor and event to be nominated.
But the thing that happened that was so beautiful was it was the first time in Oscar history, maybe the only time, that a mother and daughter were both nominated and for the same film. My mom and I—my mother, Diane Ladd, was also in “Rambling Rose.” So the call came from my publicist, Annette Wolf, because the publicists are in the room and there’s no social media, and it’s not on TV, so it’s just somebody waking you up saying… and she said, “Laura, dear, you and your mother have just both been nominated for Academy Awards for the movie.” We brought my grandmother with us, and so as a family, it was very beautiful memory.
I don’t know where Renata is. I’m waiting for her to call me. I just hope I get to meet up with her again soon, because she’s truly endless bliss for an actor. It’s amazing to play a character who, even after you’ve read the script — and we don’t have one yet for the next season — even when you arrive on set with an idea, she still shocks and surprises you. That’s the greatest experience you can have as an actor.
I think Renata is one of the few times I’ve felt that — probably the only other time was “Citizen Ruth,” a film I did with Alexander Payne. It’s that same feeling, where the character is so boundaryless you’re not sure where she’s going to take you. Renata is so powerful, such a boss — she kind of takes over me. I don’t get to be in charge. She’s driving the ship a bit, and I love that about her.
And to be with literally with my best friends on that set — oh my God — the greatest women ever. I feel so lucky.
Last year, I was in the room, and I felt such grief and such devotion amongst every single person in that room for what David Lynch meant to them, and I thought to myself, there has to be more time taken to pay tribute to the people who changed the craft forever. So that would be one thing that I wish we could figure out for sure.

It’s February, and they’re sprinting toward the end of production on “ The Running Man ,” the longest, most expensive and by far coldest shoot of Wright’s career. Days earlier, a blizzard hit the country, blanketing it in snow. Powell, who stars as a game-show contestant in a race to stay alive in Wright’s adaptation of Stephen King’s dystopian novel, had been tracking the frigid weather closely, all too aware of this upcoming scene. In it, his character evades deadly hunters by jumping out a hotel window and then rappelling down the side of a building while wearing barely a stitch.

“It’s always temporary pain for eternal cinematic glory,” Powell jokes. Popular on Variety
Wright, who built a cult following with quirky, genre-bending films — like “Hot Fuzz” and “Baby Driver” — that play like Tarantino on laughing gas, is meticulous about choreographing action sequences and obsessive about getting the perfect shot. His lens is tight on Powell, who hangs by a harness for 30 minutes while the camera resets. Wright, 51, wants to pay homage to the endurance tests Bruce Willis suffered through in “Die Hard” by taking John McClane’s barefoot skyscraper antics to the next level — and with fewer clothes.
If Bulgaria sounds arctic, it was nothing compared with Scotland, where “The Running Man” also shot. “I think I lost circulation in my leg,” Wright says. “I had so many layers on, but it was the insidious cold of Glasgow. I wasn’t sure I’d ever get warm again.”
Eight months later, Wright is relaxing in New York City on an unseasonably warm fall day. It’s five weeks before Paramount-distributed “The Running Man” opens on Nov. 14. Wright has just finished signing autographs and taking selfies with hundreds of New York Comic-Con fans who rushed the stage at the end of a panel about the movie. Comic-Con is pure costumed chaos, packed with cosplayers resembling the throngs of zombies in Wright’s “Shaun of the Dead.” That’s taking place upstairs. Wright is secluded from the mayhem in a quiet dressing room that can only be accessed via a labyrinth of tunnels — it’s fortified with enough pastries and bottled water to survive this nerd-pocalypse.
King wrote the 1982 action-adventure long before social media took over the world and, in an ironic twist, set his send-up of reality culture and totalitarianism in 2025. What once seemed like a dark and distant fantasy now has eerie parallels with our tumultuous present. For Wright, the film is a chance to put his distinctive spin on a story that was adapted into a testosterone-soaked 1987 thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger at the height of his He-Man era.
Wright’s version is set in a hellscape where the most popular show in America is “The Running Man,” a competition that offers $1 billion to any contestant who can survive a 30-day countrywide manhunt. There’s no prize for second place — only a grisly death. It’s a nightmarish premise that Wright grounds in humanity while still delivering his bravura action set-pieces. Part of the change comes from how the protagonist, Ben Richards, is portrayed. Instead of Schwarzenegger’s steroidal killing machine, Powell’s character is a hardscrabble father, so desperate to earn money for his sick kid that he risks his own life.
“We were shooting in the elements all night,” Powell says. “Edgar wanted it to feel brutal.” Before signing up for the project, Powell assured Wright that he was ready for anything the filmmaker threw at him. “I said, ‘There’s not going to be an actor who works as hard for you as I will,’” Powell recalls. “‘I’ll put my body on the line to make sure you get the movie you want to get.”
Wright, who grew up in southern England, the son of two artists, first read King in his teens, sharing paperback copies of “Night Shift,” “Salem’s Lot” and “It” with his brother, Oscar. To this day, he’s held on to his King collection, with its cracked spines and dog-eared pages.
“It was a formative experience reading King, because it was my first time reading grown-up material,” he says. “It’s more than horror; there’s attitude, world-building and humor.”
In 2017, Wright tweeted that if he could remake any movie, it would be “The Running Man.” Eight years later, he got his chance, but he doesn’t view his version as a remake of Paul Michael Glaser’s film; it hews closer to King’s dark novel.
“That movie is its own thing,” Wright explains. “This is a new adaptation. ‘A Fistful of Dollars’ is an amazing reinterpretation of ‘Yojimbo.’ David Cronenberg’s ‘The Fly’ is a wildly different take on the ’50s film. It’s a fun thing because there’s two movies from the same source that are wildly different.”
“Wildly different” describes a lot of Wright’s work since he burst on the scene with 2004’s “Shaun of the Dead,” a buddy comedy set during a George Romero-esque zombie outbreak. Stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost became two of Wright’s closest friends, and the three went on to make two more cult favorites together — “Hot Fuzz” and “The World’s End.” Those movies sent up buddy-cop films and alien-invasion flicks by way of a distinctly British perspective (there were plenty of droll asides to go along with the action scenes). Wright quickly developed a fan base among a group of American pop culture-obsessed auteurs.
“Peter Jackson, Quentin Tarantino and Sam Raimi saw themselves in Edgar,” Pegg says. “He was encyclopedic about film. That appealed to their own heritage.”
As Wright’s stature rose, he became entrusted with bigger budgets from major studios. But his unorthodox sensibility didn’t always align with that of the entertainment industry. “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” an ambitious video game-inspired romantic comedy, earned raves, but its special effects-heavy sequences sent its price tag soaring to nearly $90 million. Audiences failed to show up, and the film grossed a measly $51.7 million. However, the movie eventually reached cult-classic status with its passionate fanbase, and it even spawned an animated Netflix miniseries, “Scott Pilgrim Takes Off,” that reunited its entire cast 13 years later.
But Wright suffered an even more devastating setback, spending eight years developing an “Ant-Man” movie for Marvel, only to see the project collapse after his bespoke vision failed to jibe with Disney’s cookie-cutter superhero approach. He wanted to do something outrageous, but after “The Avengers” became a box office juggernaut, the studio opted to play it safe.
“The idea of doing it at the time excited me, because you want to put your own spin on it,” he says. “But between pitching the idea and doing it, the whole franchise had blown up. There was a house style. The thing that attracted me about it had gone away.”
“Baby Driver,” a 2017 sleeper hit about a socially awkward getaway driver, helped Wright regain his stride. The Sony Pictures release earned $227 million and proved Wright could retain his style while operating within a studio’s constraints. But he stumbled with “Last Night in Soho,” an homage to Swinging London and Polanski-esque horror films that had the misfortune of debuting in 2021, during the pandemic.
“It was a bummer promoting that movie because it was all Zoom,” Wright says. “The pandemic was not a good time for anybody at all, and no good for cinemas either.”
“The Running Man” marks Wright’s grand return to theaters with his most crowd-pleasing movie in years. Still, though King is a brand unto himself and Powell’s star is on the rise, with its $110 million budget “The Running Man” isn’t a sure thing. It arrives as many R-rated actionheavy movies aimed at adults — even those with big stars like Leonardo DiCaprio (“One Battle After Another”) or Robert Pattinson (“Mickey 17”) — are floundering at the box office. Not to mention that the film depicts fractured politics. Will audiences buy tickets for a movie set in a dystopia that mirrors their own?
“We’re as close as can be to ‘Running Man’ without people actually dying,” Wright says. “I don’t even want to predict when things will take a darker turn. I hope never.”
Much of Hollywood is freaking out that AI is coming for their jobs. It’s a subject that is front and center in “The Running Man,” which examines how the technology can be used to manipulate public opinion. Days before Wright took the stage at Comic-Con, the industry erupted over news that Tilly Norwood, an AI “actress,” had agents wanting her as a client. Her creators envision her as the next Scarlett Johansson.
“Obviously, AI is here to stay,” Wright says. “There’s no putting the toothpaste back in the tube. But when you see that Tilly Norwood thing, who’s gonna get excited about an actress that doesn’t exist?”
Bouncing his leg excitedly as he talks, Wright still hasn’t come down from the high of his “Running Man” panel and is full of energy despite having recently deplaned from a London red-eye. Being in New York has made him think back to his firstever Comic-Con in 2004, when he was promoting “Shaun of the Dead” with Pegg. “We could walk around with nobody having any idea who we were,” Wright says.
Now, Wright has just headlined a panel packed with 3,000 fans. He’s clearly an icon to his fellow film geeks. The secret to Wright’s success is that deep down he’s still just a fan. That morning, Wright reached out to King and, in the most “polite and British” way, made sure he could tell the crowd that the author liked his take on “The Running Man.”
“Like it? I love it!” King emailed back. “It’s faithful enough to the book to keep the fans happy, but different enough to make it exciting for me.” And as Wright reads the message, a grin breaks across his face.
“I’ll take that,” he says.

Senior Media Writer
Blake Lively claims she has suffered $161 million in damages due to the smear campaign launched against her during the release of “ It Ends With Us .”
Lively’s attorneys allege she has lost at least $56.2 million in past and future earnings from acting, producing, speaking engagements and endorsements. They also allege that her beauty brand, Blake Brown, has lost $49 million, and her beverage company, Betty Buzz/Betty Booze, has lost $22 million due to the harm to her image.

Lively is scheduled to go to trial next March in her lawsuit against co-star and director Justin Baldoni, producer Jamey Heath, studio head Steve Sarowitz, and their publicists. She alleges that she was targeted with online vitriol in retaliation for raising sexual harassment complaints on set. Popular on Variety
Her attorneys allege that she has suffered at least $34 million in reputational harm, based on 65 million negative impressions about her generated on social media.
In her lawsuit, first filed on Dec. 31, 2024, Lively’s attorneys stated only that her damages exceeded $75,000. But in a disclosure provided to the defense in July, and made public on Wednesday, they argued she has suffered at least $161 million in actual damages. Her attorneys will also seek at least three times that in punitive damages.
Lively’s disclosure notes that her damages figure is preliminary, and subject to proof via expert testimony at trial.
“These are wish list numbers,” said Gregory Doll, a lawyer at Doll Amir Eley in Los Angeles. “You want to put a big enough number to get the other side concerned and want to settle.”
Baldoni’s team, for its part, had argued that he suffered $400 million in damages due to her defamatory and false allegations about him. That lawsuit was dismissed in June, as a judge ruled that Baldoni’s side could not sue for defamation over allegations raised in a legal claim.
Lively’s disclosure also includes a long list of Hollywood celebrities and executives who may have information relevant to the case, though few if any of the big names are expected to actually testify. The list includes Taylor Swift, Emily Blunt, Scooter Braun, Hugh Jackman, Gigi Hadid, Ari Emanuel, Sony Pictures chairman Tony Vinciquerra, and Sony film chief Tom Rothman.
Swift’s potential involvement has been heavily litigated, with Baldoni’s camp making ultimately fruitless efforts to secure her deposition.

Artisans Editor
Georgia’s Dunaway Gardens will be the new home for the Sundance Institute Episodic Lab program.
Located in Newnan, Ga., Dunaway Gardens will be host to Sundance Institute’s immersive six-day program that provides artists with creative and strategic advice from experienced showrunners, producers and executives to help advance their projects and career.
“Dunaway Gardens has a long history of nurturing the talents of not only established artists, but emerging voices.” Dunaway Gardens founder Tena Clark said, adding, “We couldn’t be more excited that the Sundance Institute calls Dunaway its new home for this Episodic program that has been the springboard for such incredible artistry over the years.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
The immersive experience of the Episodic Lab is created to unite early-career writers with an original series IP that has not yet been produced, giving them opportunities to work under the guidance of established showrunners and development executives from studios, networks and major production companies. The fellows will workshop their pilot, pitch their series and participate in one-on-one story meetings, case study screenings, panels and writers rooms focused on advancing their series concept. The fellows are also supported through workshops prior to the lab, as well as the Sundance Institute’s yearlong continuum of support. Popular on Variety
The lab is designed to offer a training ground for independent voices, while the program is designed to help creators move their projects and careers forward.
Michelle Satter, Sundance Institute founding senior director, artist programs, said, “We are thrilled to launch an exciting new partnership with Dunaway Gardens, which will serve as the home for our Sundance Episodic Labs beginning with the 2026 Lab, running May 15–20, and continuing for years to come.” Satter went on to say, “As a cornerstone of the Sundance Institute, our Episodic Program has provided rigorous, customized creative and strategic support to hundreds of emerging writers, helping them develop original, visionary scripted episodic pilots that have elevated their careers and made an impact in the industry. This collaboration, fostered by our strong connection with Gardens Founder Tena Clark, ensures we have a natural and inspiring space to continue bringing our community together in support of emerging episodic storytellers.”
Director of the episodic program Jandiz Estrada Cardos added, “Tena and the entire Dunaway Gardens team, all creatives themselves, are taking the lead in advocacy and uplifting the importance of artist support with Sundance Institute to ensure that those with the biggest risk-taking stories have a place to come, collaborate, and be reinvigorated by these surroundings, paired with the best creative advisors and mentors in the country.”
Applications for the Sundance Institute’s 2026 Episodic Lab is now open through Nov. 9.

Spanish director Fernando Souza’s dark hybrid feature “Tonight Is Forever” and Serbian filmmaker Stefan Djordjević’s docu-drama “The Leaves Hang Trembling” took home the top honors at the Thessaloniki Film Festival ’s industry awards Wednesday night.
Set in the world of Tokyo’s red-light district, Souza’s feature debut won the 119 Marvila Studios Award, the top prize in the Agora’s Works in Progress section, offering sound mixing services in post-production. The Crossroads Co-Production Forum, meanwhile, gave its top honors — the Two Thirty-Five Co-Production Award, offering full post-production image and sound to a film that’s currently in development — to Djordjević for the follow-up to his 2025 Rotterdam-premiering debut “ Wind, Talk to Me. ” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“Tonight Is Forever,” which follows an employee at a Japanese “host club” who must confront his inner demons when his fantasy life begins to crumble, was praised by the jury for its “subtle atmosphere” and “strong cinematic language,” with the jury noting: “We felt connected with the emotional layers of this character in his pursuit of love. We were caught by the silence echoing loneliness.” Popular on Variety
The top prize in the Crossroads Co-Production Forum went to “The Leaves Hang Trembling,” which follows a teacher who is unjustly fired before her class’s graduation day, only to have her students rally on her behalf. The jury praised the film “for its unique approach to a deeply personal story that resonates with urgent global relevance,” adding: “Courageous, fierce, yet deeply empathetic, the film is profoundly moving as it puts children and students at its heart.”
The winner of the Onassis Film Award, which offers a cash prize of €10,000 ($11,500) to a Greek project participating in the Agora’s Crossroads Co-production Forum, went to the crime fantasy “The Tide Hears Them but They No Longer Have a Voice,” from director Yiannis Veslemes. Citing the winning project’s “boldness and authenticity,” the jury praised a film that “addresses one of the darkest political periods in Greece in order to speak about timeless themes and universal questions surrounding death and immortality.”
Other winners included “Promised Spaces,” an experimental feature by Serbian director Ivan Marković set against Cambodia’s rapidly expanding cityscapes, which won the Authorwave Post-Production Award offering image services in post-production to a project in the Agora Works in Progress section. In the Crossroads Co-production Forum, Spanish filmmaker Víctor Diago won an €8,000 ($9,200) award for script development from France’s CNC for his elevated horror film “The Unmoving Hands.” The ArteKino International Award, with a cash prize of €6,000 ($6,900), went to Romanian filmmaker Andreea Cristina Borțun for her social dramedy “T he Life and Times of Ion G. ,” whose producer, Gabi Suciu, also won the EAVE Thessaloniki Award, offering a EAVE Marketing Workshop scholarship to a producer in the Agora.
Thessaloniki industry head Angeliki Vergou applauded the participants in this year’s industry event, praising their “smart, courageous, political, funny, emotional” films, while festival director Orestis Andreadakis honored cinema as “an act of courage against silence,” adding: “In times when voices are censored and truths are contested, storytelling becomes a form of resistance.”
Festival general director Elise Jalladeau, meanwhile, took a moment to acknowledge the perils of a world “which is at best in crisis — political, economic, environmental — and at worst engulfed in bloodbaths and massacres we call war,” noting that “culture is not spared from the crisis.”
“We are witnessing reductions and severe cuts in cultural budgets all over Europe, and it is feared this trend will continue,” she said. “Fragility﻿ is one of the themes of this year’s festival, and we are more than aware of it here. But this fragility is not fate, and we believe in the power of collaborations and co-productions to invent together new ways of making cinema.”

International Features Editor
German production company Traumfabrik Babelsberg is doubling down on its investment in international moviemaking, with a burgeoning slate of productions with global appeal in the works, as well as its first series.
The company was founded in 2017 by Tom Zickler and Christoph Fisser, when the latter also was managing director of Babelsberg, the major film studios on the edge of Berlin, which was its parent company. Zickler was best known as the producer of German star Til Schweiger’s films up until 2016. The company takes its name from its first film, 2019’s “Traumfabrik,” which translates as “Dreamfactory.” Sadly, Zickler died of cancer in 2019 at the age of 55. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Following Fisser’s departure from Babelsberg at the beginning of last year, Traumfabrik Babelsberg was reborn as an independent entity, led by Fisser and Sebastian Fruner , who has been at the company since it began. They were then joined by Konstantin Mayer , the former COO at Veronica Ferres’ company, Construction Film Produktion. Since then, the company has been reinvigorated, and has a number of high-profile projects on its books. Popular on Variety
Talking to Variety , Fruner said that when he met Mayer in Cannes it was a “match made in heaven” as the two producers had a similar desire to make ambitious projects with the potential to find an international audience.
One film has already wrapped production and post. It is a theatrical feature produced with Kreisfilm, which is directed by Robert Gwisdek and stars Christian Friedel, best known for “The Zone of Interest” and “The White Lotus,” and Corinna Harfouch, whose credits include “Downfall” and “Never Look Away.”
The film, which is at present untitled, is described as a “philosophical drama.” It is, in part, inspired by the death of Robert Gwisdek’s father, which is intriguing as Harfouch is the director’s mother. The film will be released next year and Fruner hopes it’ll have a strong festival run, with an eye to a premiere at Berlin or Cannes. Discussions with potential German distributors are ongoing.
The film marks the beginning of a long-term collaboration with Kreisfilm, according to Traumfabrik Babelsberg, with two additional major international films now being packaged and seeking financing.
Another project is teen horror film “Bali Demons,” which is in development. It is based on an idea by Mayer, with the script written by Sophia Vester. The film is “about the conflict between cultural tradition and mass tourism,” Mayer says. He notes that in the past year or so this has become a bigger issue with public protests against mass tourism in several tourism hotspots, such as Venice, Majorca and Barcelona.
Mayer says the film is intended to be the first in a franchise, and will be followed by “Venice Demons” and “Tokyo Demons.” He says it is about “tourists behaving badly in holy places,” adding, “Nobody would go in a bikini in a church in Munich and have sex there but in Bali that happens all the time. It is disrespectful to their culture, their ancient tradition.”
In the film, “there’s a group of tourists, young, beautiful people,” he says. “I call this ‘Scream’ on Bali, or ‘Scream’ in exotic places, because one after another gets killed by a figure who has a traditional mask on.” Mayer adds, “The people start thinking, ‘Maybe the demons want to have their island back.’”
He says that some people have described it as a cross between “Scream” and “Midsommar.”
It stars Indonesian singer Adriana Raisa, German actress Helena Zengel (“The Legend of Ochi,” “News of the World,” “System Crasher”) and U.S. actor Gianni Paolo (“Ma,” “Power”). A major U.S. star and the director will be revealed soon.
The film is likely to shoot next year in Bali and is produced in association with Bo Holmgreen of Viking Sunset Studios and Orlando Bassi of Movie Studios Bali.
Traumfabrik Babelsberg is also planning to produce its first series, young adult romance “Because of You,” based on Nadine Kerger’s bestselling novels of the same name. The showrunner is Martin Schreier, whose “Maxton Hall” became the most successful non-U.S. Prime Original worldwide. The series is set at a boat club on Malta, where they plan to shoot in March 2027, with backing from German public broadcaster SWR.
The company is also producing crime comedy “Himmel, Herrgott, Hirschgeweih,” which is set in Bavaria, Southern Germany. It has been developed with German distributor Tobis Film and will receive a theatrical release. It is envisioned as a franchise.
Traumfabrik Babelsberg is also developing a spoof comedy with David Zucker, Mayer says, which will be released worldwide with a yet-to-be announced partner.
Traumfabrik Babelsberg has also experimented with AI on “Einstein – Bringing a Legend Back to Life.” Using cutting-edge AI they have brought Einstein back to life, based on a performance by actor Heiner Lauterbach, but using Einstein’s own words. The film, which is two hours and 22 minutes long, is entirely composed of AI-generated content. It was released on the Meet Your Master platform last month. Traumfabrik Babelsberg is now developing a fiction feature, “Einstein,” using the same technology.

By Clayton Davis
Senior Awards Editor
The fourth annual “Pixels and Pencils” directors roundtable brought together some of animation’s brightest talents at the SCAD Savannah Film Festival on Oct. 27, marking multiple historic firsts for the event that has become the go-to destination for animated Oscar contenders during awards season.
Variety Chief Awards Editor Clayton Davis moderated the discussion, which featured directors behind this year’s most acclaimed animated features: Ugo Bienvenu (“Arco”), Domee Shi (“ Elio “), Alex Woo (“In Your Dreams”), Chris Appelhans and Maggie Kang (“ KPop Demon Hunters “), Maïlys Vallade (“Little Amélie or the Character of Rain”) and Kent Seki (“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Chrome Alone 2 – Lost in New Jersey”). Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
The panel made history with a record-breaking number of women filmmakers and as the first to include both a returning director and an animated short. Shi became the first director to return to the panel for a second year, while Seki marked another milestone as the first short film director invited to participate.
Part of Variety’s longstanding partnership with SCAD and its awards season coverage, the “Pixels and Pencils” series has featured Oscar nominees and winners in previous years, including 2024’s “Inside Out 2,” “Memoir of a Snail,” “The Wild Robot” and eventual winner “Flow.”
The directors shared candid insights about their creative processes and the challenges of working in animation. For Shi, whose “Elio” marks her second appearance on the panel following “Turning Red” in 2022, the story was a way to connect with her younger self.
“We wanted to tell a story about being the weird kid who’s just trying to find where they belong,” she said. “For us, it was about finding your people — even if they’re alien creatures in space.”
Shi also explained the inspiration behind the film’s unconventional alien abduction scene: “Wouldn’t it be funny to have an abduction scene in a sci-fi movie where the character is whooping and cheering as they’re being taken up in a tractor beam? Because isn’t that how we all feel these days? Sometimes you’re like, I’m done with Earth, take me away.”
Several directors emphasized the collaborative nature of animation.
Kang and Appelhans discussed the collaborative process behind “KPop Demon Hunters,” celebrating the freedom to present Korean culture in a bold, fresh way. “Let’s make these characters real — ugly at times, silly, and real hot,” Kang said with a laugh. The duo’s natural chemistry and shared creative vision turned their partnership into a crowd favorite.
“Once we figured out we could attack a problem together and make it better, it became hard to work apart,” Appelhans added. “We just have the same exact taste, which is so crazy,” Kang said, noting how they wanted to make every decision together despite production pressures to divide responsibilities.
Throughout the afternoon, panelists opened up about the inspirations, anxieties and ambitions behind their work.
Bienvenu spoke of creating Neon’s “Arco” during the pandemic, inspired by a desire to imagine a better future. “Maybe the world is how it is because we only imagine it bad,” he said. “Let’s imagine things better.”
Vallade, director of the hand-drawn “Little Amélie” from GKids, spoke through an interpreter about embracing animation’s emotional power. “Yes, animation is a lot of suffering,” she said to laughs. “But it’s also about sharing love, dreams and emotion. We can maybe change the world — even a little.”
Woo described Netflix’s “In Your Dreams” as a deeply personal exploration of disappointment and resilience. “I grew up on stories that said if you want something badly enough, it will come true. But that’s not always the case,” he said. “I wanted to make a movie for kids that asks, ‘What happens when your dreams don’t come true?'”
Seki, whose “Chrome Alone 2” screened at SCAD earlier in the day, reflected on pushing through rejection. “I once had someone in power say to my face, ‘I don’t see you as a director,'” he said. “But you keep going. You have to have creative endurance and elasticity.”
In a surprise twist that delighted the sold-out audience, SCAD animation student Anthony DiMarco of Middletown, New Jersey, was invited on stage to co-host portions of the discussion after confidently declaring he would direct the first animated film to win the best picture Oscar.
In a powerful final segment, DiMarco asked each filmmaker to give him one piece of advice as a future director. Responses ranged from the philosophical — “Tell the truth,” said Woo — to the practical. “Don’t be afraid to be embarrassing,” advised Shi. Kang might have summed it up best: “Network up, down, sideways — and don’t be an asshole.”
DiMarco’s participation became a highlight of the event, with the student asking thoughtful questions about overcoming imposter syndrome and handling rejection. “This experience today has taught me that animation is about passion, perseverance — and having at least three, maybe four backup drives,” DiMarco quipped, reading from cue cards provided. “Animation is cinema. It’s a medium, not a genre.”
Seki also shared wisdom from director Jon Favreau: “Your job is to be a statesman. You have information that you have to give to everybody on the crew. Your job is to know when, where and how to give that information.”
The eight-day SCAD Savannah Film Festival, presented by the Savannah College of Art and Design, showcases cinematic creativity from award-winning professionals and emerging student filmmakers. Previous “Pixels and Pencils” panels have launched the Oscar campaigns of filmmakers including Peter Sohn (“Elemental”), the “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” directing team and Dean Fleischer Camp (“Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”).
With more than 63,000 attendees annually, the SCAD Savannah Film Festival continues to be a thriving space for both emerging talent and established artists. “Pixels and Pencils” remains a marquee moment during the eight-day celebration — a space where art meets industry, and the next great animated feature might just be born.
As many of us believe, there will be an animated film win best picture. And maybe — just maybe — the person who directs it, was sitting in that room. And judging by DiMarco, and the eight extraordinary filmmakers dropped on their way out, they’re all ready to take that shot.

Buzz Hays wants to make sure his colleagues in Hollywood understand the pros and cons of generative AI, in particular, fine-tuning models.

Discovery’s “ The Wizard of Oz ” at the Sphere event in Las Vegas back in August .

“The thing that got us through this project is a process that sometimes gets confused, and I’ve heard people use the terms incorrectly, but there’s a process called fine-tuning of the models,” Hays told Variety . “I could say, give me an output of the Tin Man doing something without the model understanding anything about the actual Tin Man, so it comes up with some vague approximation. But that’s not good enough when you’re doing something like this. So we actually fine-tuned our models, which is a process that basically allows any IP owner to take a base model that’s been trained and has been using all the sources that people have opted into, to contribute to. So it’s a legitimate model, but it doesn’t understand the Tin Man. So what we can now do is fine-tune it on the Tin Man to say, ‘OK, you know how people move. Now we have a person that looks like this. So whenever we refer to Tin Man, please use this version of Tin Man for that.'” Popular on Variety
Hays continued: “In that case, we had fine-tuned models for each of the main characters in the movie, and that allowed us to have a faithful reproduction of those actors, no matter where they looked and how close they were to camera, and if they turned around. Things like, what does the back of the Tin Man’s head look like? Because there’s not a lot of that in the movie, but there’s a couple of shots in there that we could tune on so that in those occasions where he had to turn his head, we knew exactly what he looked like.”
Hays, who was a Hollywood producer for more than three decades before transitioning to his current position at the tech giant, says “all of the data that’s used for that is owned and maintained by the customer” and “it never gets assumed into the model.” The Google Cloud entertainment industry boss wants to make sure this concept is crystal clear moving forward, because he sees the tech only becoming more integral to the production process across the film and TV industries.
“That’s where the power of AI comes. I think especially with franchise titles, we have to have a certain likeness that is persistent throughout the series, then it starts to make sense that these fine-tune models exist for that particular reason,” Hays said. “So I think it kind of runs the gamut when it comes to how these things get leveraged as to what makes for a successful output and what doesn’t.”
Hays emphasized that while this tech is here to stay, Google Cloud has put in place “significant guardrails” to protect IP and likeness as it continues to expand throughout entertainment.
“We don’t allow our models to generate a known celebrity or likeness of anybody. There’s very careful protections put on those,” Hays said. “We have guardrails on things like violence. We have guardrails on generating children, a bunch of these things. So all these guardrails contribute to this indemnification policy idea that we will protect you but don’t do bad things, basically what it is, but we don’t even allow you to do bad things, because those those guardrails are protecting that.”
Hays points to how those principles were used for “The Wizard of Oz” at the Sphere project and says he “values” the restrictions put on what the Google Cloud team can do with generative AI.
“It was really about, how can we honor this original film?” Hays said. “We have a lot of restrictions that came from the studio that says, you can’t have an actress replace Dorothy’s performance, for example. You can’t replace voices. You can’t use motion capture to do a new performance that didn’t exist in the original, those kinds of things. I’m a big fan of restrictions in filmmaking. I think the best art comes from restrictions, not from unlimited possibilities. So it was a really interesting way to work on this.”

By Jenelle Riley
Deputy Awards and Features Editor
Even before he had doppelgängers of his most famous character from an iconic horror franchise roaming Hollywood Boulevard, Robert Englund spent a lot of time on that particular stretch of pavement. He attended premieres at the Chinese Theatre with his parents, the same spot where he would later go on dates before stopping by C.C. Brown’s for hot chocolate and ice cream sundaes. And he dreamed of a career as an actor, particularly after one showing of “West Side Story.” Says Englund, “I remember snapping my fingers up the aisle at the end, wanting to be a Jet or a Shark, and stepping out into the lobby and being blinded by daylight because it was a matinee.” His first agent even had an office there. So it makes perfect sense that Englund will become a part of its history when he receives his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Oct. 31. “It’s very special to me, that great old broad of a street,” he jokes. Englund started out young, landing theater roles by age 12. He later studied several places, including Oakland University’s Meadow Brook Theater, then a branch of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. It was there that a tutor gave him some career advice. “He said, ‘If you had no talent at all, you’re kind of a funny-looking kid — you’ll work.’ Gee, thanks,” Englund says with a laugh. Of course, Englund’s most famous role would involve obscuring that face under layers of prosthetics and makeup to portray Freddy Krueger, the child killer burned to death who wears a glove of metal claws and hunts people in their dreams in “A Nightmare on Elm Street” films. When director Wes Craven first cast him in the 1984 film that started it all, Englund had no idea how it would affect his career. “I don’t even have much to say in the first movie,” he points out. Englund thinks the character struck a chord because Freddy was the symbol for a loss of innocence. “There’s these kids, dreaming of the future, and Freddy is polluting those dreams,” he notes. “He has no future, and so he kills the future. There’s a dark, subconscious poetic feel to it.” Englund laughs and admits, “Now I’m not saying every teenager in the octoplex with a bucket of buttered popcorn is thinking about that intellectually, but they do sense it emotionally. And there is an unrepentant, politically incorrect villain with a dose of personality. Those things together are some of the reasons for the popularity of the character.” But Englund proved to be more than a mascot, using his training and talent to parlay his role into a robust career as actor and director. He has also found steady employment in voice acting — he’s currently lending his vocal talents to the Cricket in the upcoming horror film “Pinocchio: Unstrung.” And over the years, he’s been at the forefront of watching the respect for the horror genre grow. “Something I love is that it’s really opened the door for the imagination,” he notes. “Anything you can conceive of, anything you can imagine, you can do.” And now it’s led him to a star on the Walk of Fame, one he promises to visit when he can. “I’ll go by a couple times a year with a little bottle of Windex and clean it up,” he jokes. “I’ll take my claws to scrape the gum off.” Tipsheet WHAT Robert Englund receives a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame WHEN Oct. 31, 11:30 a.m. WHERE 6644 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood WEB walkoffame.com Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'

TV Business Writer
It’s been one week since prolific author Neal Stephenson and “The Lord of the Rings” VFX studio Wētā Workshop launched web game “Artefact,” what they hope will be a seminal piece of media in the entertainment landscape to come.
Housed on platform Lamina1 , “ Artefact ” is described as “a collaborative worldbuilding experience” that “invites players to step into the aftermath of the Spike — a fizzled singularity that tore the internet apart, ended the reign of AI megasystems, and forced humanity to rebuild through new, decentralized systems.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
The goal here is to experiment with the process of IP creation and owndership when driven by fandom. It’s the flagship project for Lamina1, one of several “Spaces” planned by the platform run by Stephenson and co-founder and CEO Rebecca Barkin. Popular on Variety
“With ‘Artefact,’ you have a really, truly new original IP, almost a post-AI mythos,” “Artefact” executive producer Ryan Gill told Variety . “We just don’t have much of that. And when it does move into adaptation of other Spaces — film, television, book, all this stuff — the organizing principle will stay at Spaces with all the people that were a part of it early on, and really have a foundational understanding and a participation. And it’s a vehicle for how to prove that out, really, and how IP can be built from that natively and shaped through that. And that’s what Spaces will do for other IP as well.”
“Artefact” gameplay begins with players acquiring a thumb drive and booting up their rig — a salvaged machine stitched together from CPUs, drives, and scraps of machine code — to go in search of artefacts, evolving digital entities capable of storing and transmitting lost knowledge. Players are working together to find artefacts as they continue to appear across Lamina1, while building trust within their player communities, known as Phyle, in order to uncover the great mystery at the center of the game.
If that sounds like a lot, the “Artefact” team is aware of that, and they’ve spent a great deal of time considering how to make it as easy to play for as many people as possible.
“When we’ve worked on taking existing IP and trying to turn it into interactive IP, that’s sort of how you get people to move from passive consumption into, how do I interact and create with the world?” Barkin said. “It’s a really tough battle, because sometimes people just want to consume. So we had to think about different barriers of entry and different ways in for different types of profiles of people and players. And one of the reasons why we decided to allow people to contribute PDFs or images or things like that, it’s just to lower the barrier of entry. Of being able to insert yourself and your ideas into a game world, because otherwise you’d have to be a developer to do that.”
Seven days after “Artefact’s” Oct. 31 launch, there are currently 372 listed members in the game’s community on Lamina1 . Barkin says those players may have a leg up in the long term, having been part of the community from Day 1, but that’s far fro the only way to interact with “Artefact” as it grows.
“There will be different entry points for new people to keep coming into the game when they’re comfortable,” Barkin said. “And I think that’s an important piece of it. We debated this a lot, in terms of the rollout strategy of, how do people get in? And if minting is your way in, how do we make sure that — because word of mouth is really going to be our best asset — that there’s new entry points all the time for people to come into the game. Maybe not with the same advantages that those early people will have, but still in a way that’s really enjoyable and accessible.”
Gill likens the “Artefact” format to two tried-and-true methods for entertainment: procedural and serial.
“Looking at the paradigm of episodic storytelling, because streaming has really taken over so much now people are used to episodes and binging and all this kind of stuff — in the video game sense, it’s kind of combining that, in a way,” Gill said “We have procedural and serial. We have this in phases.”
Gill says the procedural portion will see each phase of the game be “another space of the world that you can go to and you interact with people, and there might be side missions and things that you help out with.”
“It’s kind of combining an episodic way of telling stories and then blending that with what we’re used to feeling like a video game feels like, but really, at the core, it being like a literary narrative experience,” Gill said. “You get the richness of a Neal novel, for example, but it is experienced in a much more dynamic and immersive way. And this is not fixed. This is like a pilot episode — episode one of Season 1. And it is very much going to evolve, and we’re not going to be the ones that determine all the ways that it evolves.”
The “Artefact” team has made it so those decisions will be up to the creator community.

TV Business Writer
Amazon reported its third-quarter 2025 earnings Thursday, revealing revenue rose 13% for the June-September period.
The financial update comes amid mass layoffs at Amazon : The company is undergoing a workforce reduction of 14,000 employees this week.
During a call with investors following the earnings release, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy fielded a question about the layoffs at Amazon this week and backtracked on AI innovations being the primary driver for the cuts. Popular on Variety Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially-driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven. Not right now at least. It really, it’s culture,” Jassy said. “And if you grow as fast as we did for several years — the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you’re in — you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers. And when that happens, sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work and who own most of the two-way-door decisions. The ones that should be made quickly and right at the front line. And it can lead to slowing you down.”
“As a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world’s largest startup,” he continued. “That means removing layers. It means increasing the amount of ownership that people have, and it means inventing and moving quickly. And I don’t know if there’s ever been a time in the history of Amazon or maybe business in general, with the technology transformation happening right now, where it’s important to be lean, important to be flat, and it’s important to move fast, and that’s what we’re going to do.””
For the Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment, Amazon saw a 20% increase in sales compared to Q3 2024 with revenue standing at $33 billion.
The ecommerce giant’s domestic sales were up 11% at $106.3 billion. International sales reached $40.9 billion, up 14% (or 10%, when accounting for foreign exchange rates). Amazon ad sales rose 24% to $17.7 billion.
Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.56 on $177.8 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG. Amazon reported adjusted EPS of $1.95 on $180.2 billion in revenue.
Per Amazon, “Operating income was $17.4 billion in the third quarter, compared with $17.4 billion in third quarter 2024. Third quarter 2025 operating income includes two special charges—$2.5 billion related to a legal settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and $1.8 billion in estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. Without these charges, operating income would have been $21.7 billion.”

By Cynthia Littleton
Business Editor
TKO has raised its full-year guidance on the momentum generated by its big-bucks new deals with Paramount and ESPN for rights to UFC and WWE events.
The parent company of the MMA league and wrestling franchise had a mixed third quarter with revenue down on tough year-over-year comps from last year’s Summer Olympic Games in Paris. UFC also held one less pay-per-view event and no presence at Las Vegas’ Sphere, compared to the year-ago frame. At the same time, costs were down significantly so that improved the adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and net income were both up, powered by gains for WWE and IMG.

“TKO delivered solid third quarter financial results, and with UFC and WWE’s sustained momentum, we are once again raising our full-year guidance,” said Ariel Emanuel, TKO’s executive chair and CEO. “Having secured landmark multiyear media rights deals for UFC, WWE and Zuffa Boxing, our conviction in TKO has never been stronger. We remain focused on operational execution, including preparing for UFC’s launch with Paramount, further integrating and unlocking synergies with IMG, On Location, and PBR, and maximizing shareholder value.” Popular on Variety
Total revenue was down 27% to $1.120 billion. Net income hit $106.8 million, a big swing from $3.4 million in Q3 2024. Free cash flow was a healthy $398.9 million, an increase of $247.9 million from $151.0 million, due to the increase in cash flows generated by operating activities and a decrease in capital expenditures.
For the third consecutive quarter, TKO increased its full-year target for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Revenue is now projected at $4.69 billion to $4.72 billion and adjusted EBITDA was lifted to $1.57 billion to $1.58 billion. For the year to date ended Sept. 30, TKO total revenue stood at $3.69 billion and adjusted EBITDA came in at $1.3 billion.
Emanuel and Mark Shapiro, TKO president and chief operating officer, were pressed by analysts during the company’s conference call for details on how the $7.7 billion, seven-year UFC rights deal came together with Paramount+ and CBS. Shapiro emphasized that UFC still has runway to strike lucrative rights deals outside the U.S.
“Overall [Paramount] ended up having the best equation, which is best for our brand, best marketing plan, a holistic effort, given what they’re doing on the domestic side with that investment,” Shapiro said. And, of course, the best rights fee. So for us, it’s always going to be brand, reach, dollars.”
Despite the momentum behind UFC and WWE, Shapiro kept the chest-beating to a minimum.
“We knew we were going to have a nice bidding war because it was attractive and it has strong fan bases and and we capitalized on it,” Shapiro said. “Nobody here has taken a victory lap, not on those specific territories in that deal, or really even on the quarterly earnings here. We’re proud of where we are. We’re proud of the road ahead. We’re cautiously optimistic.”

Anyone wanting to argue the riches of European films need go no further than the new talents spotlighted at this year’s Seville European Film Festival which launched last year a Rampa section for first and second features and has added short films to its lineup in 2025. Variety highlights seven features and five short films, championed by critics and announcing most certainly talent to keep on the radar:
“The Anatomy of the Horses,” (“La Anatomía de los Caballos,”Daniel Vidal Toche, Playa Chica Films, Sideral, Spain; Pioneros Producciones, Peru; Los Niños Films, Colombia; Mito Films, Promenades Films, France). Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Picked up by Loco Films and backed by the Berlin Festival’s World Cinema Fund, and put through EAVE’s Puentes, MRG Work, Ventana Sur’s Proyecta and Málaga’s Mafiz, a take on Peruvian history not far from the pessimism of “One Hundred Years of Solitude”: Revolutions don’t work, Peru is “trapped in an unbroken cycle,” he tells Variety . Jumping from 18th century to modern-day corporate degradation, originally shot, a film style and substance. Popular on Variety
“Dandelion’s Odyssey,” (Momoko Seto, Miyu Productions, Ecce Films, Arte Cinéma, U Media, France, Belgium)
A boundary-pushing animation odyssey using time-lapse, macro-photography, robotics, periscopes and drones to picture four friends, dandelion seeds, floating off into the cosmos from an Earth destroyed by nuclear war. Seto’s fifth work but first feature, “an experimental animated feature unlike anything you’ve seen before,” proclaims Cartoon Brew. Sold by Indie Sales, a Cannes Fipresci Award and Annecy Animation Festival winner.
“The Last One for the Road,” (“Le Citta di Pianura,” Francesco Sossai, A Vivo Film, Rai Cinema, Maze Pictures, Italy)
50-somethings Carlobianchi and Doriano chain-booze their way from life, dispensing advice, bar-hopping, exchanging stories and escaping the police. A Cannes Un Certain Regard player with a more melancholic undercurrent rated by Variety as a  “pleasant Italian gem on drinking buddies, aging and wistful flavors of life.”
“My Father’s Shadow,” (Element Pictures, Fatherland Productions, BBC Film, BFI, Crybaby, U.K.)
“Nigeria’s first ever Cannes selection marks a miraculous gem of auto-fiction,” Variety proclaimed of “My Father’s Shadow.” “In his feature film debut, Akinola Davies Jr. announces himself as a major cinematic voice,” it added. “One day in the life of two young boys traveling with their father from a small village in rural Nigeria to the bustling capital city Lagos.” But an “intimate and well-observed drama” ends up in a way so devastating it completely upends the movie, elevating it into a deeply humanist narrative.”
“A Year of School,” (Laura Samani, Nefertiti Film, RAI Cinema, Tomsa Films, Arte France Cinéma, Italy).
Winning best actor honors for newcomer Giacomo Covi at this year’s Venice Horizons, Samani’s second feature and a turn-up for the books after her year 800 Frigian community-set “Small Body,” set in 2007 as Fred, Swedish, enrolls in an all-male senior year class of a technical high school in Trieste, soon joining a gang of three close male friends. “About desire,” and “the way the world allows us to express these desires,” which differs for females,” Samani tells Variety .
“Short Summer,” (Nastia Korkia, Tamtam Film, Totem Atelier, Art & Popcorn, Germany, France, Serbia)
This year’s Venice Lion of the Future and Chicago New Directors winner, sold by Totem Films and the fiction feature debut of Korkia, now based in France and Germany. A drama set during the second Chechen war, it turns on eight year-old Katya (Maiia Pleshkevich), on summer holidays with her grandparents at their country house. Filmed with fixed-camera shots, an eye to documentary-like details as war insinuates itself into daily life.
“We Believe You,” (Charlotte Devillers, Arnaud Dufeys, Mackintosh Films, Belgium)
Sold widely by The Party Sales to Germany, France and Spain and most Eastern Europe, and described by Variety as a “gripping family custody drama,” a Berlin’s Perspectives player, garnering a Special Mention. Myriem Akheddiou delivers an extraordinary performance, often caught in close-up, of a mother under extreme stress, underscoring the best that Belgium offers: Tough and informed social drama. “We meet victims of sexual assault, and some of them reveal incest to us,” says Devillers, a nurse.
Short Films
“Baile de Feria” (Rakia Films, Te Lo Garantizo Producciones , Spain )
Set against the atmosphere of the Seville April Fair, “ Baile de Feria” meaning Fair Dance traces the bond between a father experiencing cognitive impairment and the daughter who reconnects with him through shared music, movement and ritual. Directed by Bernabé Bulnes, the short blends domestic scenes with the fairgrounds and its “Calle del Infierno,” locating the bond of family entwined within local tradition.
“Dad’s Not Home” (Szkoła Filmowa im. Krzysztofa Kieślowskiego, Poland)
Winner of the Student Academy Award for best narrative short, “Dad’s Not Home” follows two young brothers who conceal their father’s frontotemporal dementia in order to remain together after their mother’s death.

“Éiru” (Cartoon Saloon, HerStory, Ireland)
Giovanna Ferrari directs this Iron-Age mythic adventure of a young girl who journeys underground to restore her community’s water source, a lifegiving essential stolen by magic.

“A Good Day” (Portugal Films – Portugal)
António wakes to find a lifeless double of himself floating in the family pool, a discovery that unsettles the household as they attempt to carry on while quietly grieving the inexplicable presence. Doubts arise as to who and what António is. Directed by Tiago Rosa-Rosso, the film stages a gently absurd domestic scenario that drifts between comedy and unease, unfoldig like a theatrical chamber piece where logic slips and all is up for questioning.
“Yonne” (Rita Productions, Norte Productions, Switzerland, France)
Set in mid-19th-century Burgundy, “Yonne” follows two sisters who disguise themselves as men to join a timber raft crew. Their destination is Paris and perhaps a hope for an improved life than what they flee. Co-directed by Julietta Korbel and Yan Ciszewski, the short underscores the physical strain and vulnerability of the flotteurs as they navigate a pastoral river route. Selected for Locarno’s Pardi di Domani before appearing in Seville’s Official Shorts, the film traces emancipation, hiding and survival of spirit through labor, movement and shifting bodies.

NY Digital Editor
Spotify saw double-digit growth on its free and paid-subscription tiers for the third quarter of 2025, as the audio streaming delivered results that met or beat Wall Street forecasts.
The company’s added 5 million paid Premium subscribers, up 12% to 281 million. Overall monthly active users grew 11% to 713 million, a better-than-expected 17 million net gain.
Total Spotify Q3 revenue increased 7% to €4.27 billion (or 12% on a constant currency basis) while advertising revenue declined -6% (or flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis). Growth in music and podcast advertising sales — driven by growth in impressions sold — was offset by “softness in pricing and optimization of our podcasting inventory in our Owned & Licensed portfolio,” Spotify said in announcing earnings.

Operating income for Q3 was €582 million, up 43%, and Spotify swung to a €899 million net profit, versus a net loss of €86 million in the year-earlier period. Popular on Variety
“The business is healthy. We’re shipping faster than ever,” Daniel Ek , Spotify founder and CEO, said in prepared remarks. “And we have the tools we need — pricing, product innovation, operational leverage, and eventually the ads turnaround — to deliver both revenue growth and profit expansion. It all comes back to user fundamentals and that’s where we are: 700 million users who keep coming back, engagement at all-time highs. We’re building Spotify for the long-term.”
At the start of 2026, Ek is relinquishing his role as CEO to become executive chairman . As of Jan. 1, Spotify will have two co-CEOs: Gustav Söderström, currently co-president and chief product and technology officer, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.
At the end of Q3, Spotify had 7,323 full-time employees globally.
In Q3, Spotify launched 30 new features and updates for both Free and Premium users, including an enhanced Free tier, playlist mixing tools, lossless audio , a ChatGPT integration and in-app DMs . The overriding goal is to make it easier for users to discover and create content on the platform, while driving engagement and time spent.
Last month, Spotify inked a deal with Netflix to stream a collection of original podcasts on Netflix worldwide . Spotify shows set to come to Netflix starting in 2026 include “The Bill Simmons Podcast” sports and pop-culture interview series; “The Rewatchables” show breaking down classic films; and true-crime series “Serial Killers.”
Meanwhile, Spotify also last month announced a new deal with Amazon that gives advertisers using Amazon DSP programmatic access to Spotify’s streaming audio and video inventory , alongside a similar deal with Yahoo.
For Q4, Spotify expects revenue of €4.5 billion (which would be up 6%) and operating income of €620 million (versus €477 million a year earlier).
The company is forecasting total Q4 user net adds of 32 million MAUs, to reach 745 million by the end of 2025, and to add 8 million paid subs to reach 289 million.

NY Digital Editor
YouTube , the internet’s biggest video streaming platform, continues to flex its muscles as an advertising powerhouse, again delivering solid double-digit growth for the third quarter of 2025.
YouTube advertising revenue for the period was $10.26 billion, a year-over-year increase of 15%. That beat analyst forecasts of $10.01 billion, per StreetAccount. The figure doesn’t include revenue generated by YouTube’s subscriptions business, but advertising represents the bulk of YouTube’s sales.

In addition, parent company Alphabet announced that it has more than 300 million paid subscriptions in total, led by growth in Google One cloud storage and YouTube Premium. Popular on Variety
Overall, Alphabet’s Q3 results that came in above Wall Street forecasts. The company reported revenue of $102.35 billion, up 16%, and net income of $34.98 billion (up 33%), translating to earnings per share of $2.87. Total Google ad revenue (including YouTube) was $74.18 billion, up 12.6%.
“Alphabet had a terrific quarter, with double-digit growth across every major part of our business,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said in prepared remarks. On the earnings call, he said, “We are seeing AI now driving real business results across the company.”
Pichai said that in the U.S., YouTube Shorts — its TikTok-like short-form video format — now generates more revenue per watch hour than traditional in-stream video (although Shorts overall represents a small share of its video advertising sales). He also called out YouTube’s introduction of new AI features for creators , announced at its Made on YouTube event last month, and the platform’s first NFL game broadcast, the Sept. 5 Chiefs-Chargers matchup from Brazil, which drew more than 19 million viewers worldwide and had the most concurrent users for an YouTube livestream to date, according to Pichai.
Citing growth across the company and demand for Google Cloud, Alphabet said it now expects 2025 capital expenditures to be in a range of $91 billion-$93 billion, up from $85 billion previously. CFO Anat Ashkenazi said the company expects to see a “significant” increase in capex in 2026 with more detail to be provided on the Q4 earnings call.
Alphabet dodged a bullet last month after a federal judge rejected the U.S. government’s proposal to force Google to sell its Chrome browser , after the internet giant lost an antitrust case finding that it has a monopoly on search. The judge ruled that Google must share certain kinds of data with competitors and is prohibited from entering into exclusive distribution deals.
In other news, YouTube is undertaking a significant revamp of its product organization . Veteran exec Christian Oestlien is heading a newly created Subscriptions Products group, which includes YouTube TV, Music and Premium; Johanna Voolich, formerly YouTube’s chief product officer, will lead the new Viewer Products team; and YouTube is looking to hire an exec to lead a third separate product organization, Creator & Community Products.
Earlier this month, YouTube began rolling out its “Second Chance” program that will allow some previously terminated creators the opportunity to request a new channel. That includes users who were previously banned over now-retired policies prohibiting misinformation about the 2020 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19 .
Meanwhile, in September, Alphabet agreed to pay a total of $24.5 million to settle President Trump’s lawsuit alleging “censorship” over YouTube’s suspension of his channel following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Of that, $22 million was paid to Trump, who designated that the money go toward the construction of his new White House ballroom.

By Elsa Keslassy
International Correspondent
Simon Rex (“ Red Rocket “), Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi (“Predator: Badlands”) and Grace Palmer (“Animal Control”) are set to star in “God Bless You, Mr Kopu,” the anticipated debut feature from rising Tongan-New Zealand filmmaker Alex Liu (“The Red Room”).
Liu penned the screenplay for “God Bless You, Mr Kopu” which won the MGM/Black List open script deal in 2022. The project begins principal photography next week in Auckland, New Zealand, and will be introduced to buyers at the AFM. Radiant Films International has boarded the project for worldwide sales, while AC Independent represents North American rights. Umbrella Entertainment will handle distribution in Australia and New Zealand.

The high-concept dark comedic thriller follows Mafu (Schuster-Koloamatangi), a struggling Tongan immigrant who becomes the protégé of charismatic American salesman Marco Cass (Rex). What begins as a dream job quickly unravels into a nightmare as Mafu starts to question his mentor’s methods. Popular on Variety
Liu, whose latest short “The Red Room” premiered at SXSW Sydney, said “his aim as a filmmaker has always been to expose audiences to Tongan stories in ways we haven’t seen before.”
“‘God Bless You, Mr Kopu’ is a twisted ride with a Tongan protagonist that wears its genre influence on its sleeve,” Liu continued.
Rex, meanwhile, said “Alex is a talented filmmaker, I love the script, and I can’t wait for global audiences to experience his genius. It’s gonna be crispy.”
“God Bless You, Mr Kopu” is produced by Roxi Bull for Velvet Moss and Tania Chambers for Feisty Dame Productions. Executive producers are Velvet Moss’ Emma Slade and Timpson Films’ Ant Timpson, alongside Rex, who produces under his recently launched Crispy Productions banner. Truant Pictures’ Toby Nalbandian and Gregory Schmidt, Radiant’s Mimi Steinbauer and A.C. Neel, Umbrella’s Ari Harrison and Jasmin McSweeney, Sandbox’s Grady Habib, and Beatriz Martins also serve as executive producers. The film is produced by Velvet Moss and Feisty Dame Productions in association with the New Zealand Film Commission, Screenwest and Lotterywest, and Truant Pictures.

The 22nd Seville European Film Festival will double down on an expanded big-tent model — citywide venues, broader audiences and a beefed-up industry platform — as the European Film Awards nominations return to the city.
Running Nov. 7–15, the 2025 edition opens with Anders Thomas Jensen’s “The Last Viking,” toplining Mads Mikkelsen, and pays tribute with Giraldillos of Honor to four cross-generational heavyweights: Juliette Binoche – presenting her directorial debut “In-I in Motion” — France-based master Costa-Gavras, Irish auteur Jim Sheridan and Seville native Alberto Rodríguez (“Marshland,” “Los tigres”).

“This year is one of consolidation — showing off the city, and talking about European cinema in its full breadth,” festival director Manuel Cristóbal says. “The big change happened last year,” he argues. “This year is scale, reliability and usefulness.” Popular on Variety
Cristóbal defines “consolidation” in concrete, local terms. “Above all, it’s about bringing the festival closer to the city and taking pride in it,” he says. “We also want to offer European cinema in the widest sense of the word — it’s not a niche and it’s far more varied than we’re often led to believe.”
A new competitive European shorts section
For the first time, Seville’s Official Selection introduces a competitive European shorts section spanning live-action and animation — a talent pipeline that complements 2024’s launch of Rampa for emerging directors.
The festival also rolls out an immersive cinema showcase at the Cartuja Center CITE, cementing a strategic alliance with the venue. With a 180-square-meter screen and Meyer sound, Cartuja Center represents the technical flagship for marquee moments.
The outward-facing push is also ceremonial. On Nov. 8, the festival hosts a reception at the Real Alcázar palace for the Puerta América prize, spotlighting European films representing their countries in the Oscar race.
The return to the city of the EFA nominations on Nov. 18 is freighted with symbolism. “It means a great deal,” Cristóbal says. “Above all, the festival is back after a crisis brought on by the previous municipal team — and not only it is back in Seville, it’s back at the Real Alcázar, one of the city’s most magical sites.”
European Film Exhibition Conference
Frame Sevilla, the festival’s professional hub, scales up to 30-plus sessions — a curated spread of keynotes, case studies, finance labs and networking.
The headline innovation is the inaugural European Film Exhibition Conference, organized with Spain’s exhibitors’ federation FECE, delivering four blocks of discussions that will feed into a public report on policy, funding levers and audience evolution.
A heavyweight roster of E.U. and national entities — including UNIC, Eurocinema, Italy’s ANEC and Spain’s ICAA — will attend this industry event. “Exhibitors keep theaters open — we have to listen to them and treat them with respect,” Cristóbal says.
Alliances and growth paths
Cristóbal underscores new and deepening partnerships. “We’re looking for partners and, above all, to be useful to industry and films,” he says.
Seville boasts deals with European Film Promotion on Future Frames program and has teamed with Spain’s rights management organisation Egged to boost the visibility of producers’ work.
On its industry side, the festival will also cast an eye north with “A Look at Denmark,” syncing with opening-night “The Last Viking” and the recent awards surge for Magnus von Horn’s “The Girl with the Needle.”
In tandem with the Danish Film Institute and Denmark’s embassy, Frame will unpack the Nordic production-financing model and dissect recent co-production workflows.
Netflix joins for sessions on innovation and sustainability, while Secuoya Content Group and Sevilla Film & Events present Sevilla Content City, a local stages-and-services push.
Returning finance roundtables El Parné/Show Me the Money” offer first-look strategies for packaging and closing deals. The discovery pipeline is reinforced by EFP’s Future Frames — in partnership with Karlovy Vary and spun out to Hamburg and Seville — bringing young helmers into the SEFF ecosystem with shorts spotlights and talent meetings.
An opening-night comedy
For Spanish distributor Avalon, Seville’s choice of an opening-night comedy such as “The Last Viking” signals commercial intent.
“We’re especially thrilled that a festival of this caliber is betting on a comedy as its opening film,” says Avalon founder Stefan Schmitz. “This consecrates it as a potential event movie for a broad audience — and a major promotional boost ahead of the commercial release in March.”
An across-the-board presence of Spanish and Andalusian productions
Spanish and Andalusian signatures thread the lineup. Rodríguez collects his Giraldillo as “Los tigres,” a Movistar Plus+ original film, distributed in Spain by Buena Vista International, bows as a Special Screening; while Rafael Cobos, Rodríguez’s longtime co-writer, brings his feature debut thriller “Golpes,” a Vaca Films co-production with France’s Playtime, to Panorama Andaluz sidebar.
Elsewhere, Andalusian non-fiction ranges from gypsy people’s history vindication (“Pendaripen,” by Alfonso Sánchez) to art portraits (“Luis Gordillo. Manual de instrucciones”) and music-driven journeys (“Fandango”), amplifying what Seville frames as a “transversal” presence of southern voices across sections.
European auteurs and emergent names
European auteurs and emergent names collide across strands. In Official Selection, animation sits alongside live-action via Sylvain Chomet’s “A Magnificent Life,” while films from high-profile festivals alumni filter in  — among them Hafsia Herzi’s “La petite dernière,” with Cannes best-actress winner Nadia Melliti; Dag Johan Haugerud’s Berlinale Golden Bear winner “Dreams (Sex Love)”; and the posthumous Laurent Cantet work “Enzo,” completed by Robin Campillo.
Meanwhile, Michał Kwieciński’s lavish biopic “Chopin, Chopin!,” sold by Playtime and acquired for Spain by LaZona Pictures, closes the festival out of competition.
In the Embrujo sidebar – formerly Las Nuevas Olas – Seville frames bolder language-benders, from Momoko Seto’s dialogue-free eco-fable “Dandelion’s Odyssey” to Sofía Petersen’s 16mm reverie “Olivia.”
Rampa corrals first and second features that straddle genre and personal history: Croatian helmer Hana Jušić’s Locarno-laureled “God Will Not Help,” Nigerian filmmaker Akinola Davies Jr.’s Cannes prized “My Father’s Shadow” and Déni Oumar Pitsaev’s “Imago,” a Cannes’ French Touch/Oeil d’Or prize-winner.
“We need films for different audiences — not every title for everyone, but everyone should find their film,” Cristóbal says.
That is consistent with Seville’s reinforced promise to be a launchpad for both auteur discoveries and broader-audience titles that roll out after the festival, for example Mediaset España’s “Todos los lados de la cama,” a new entry in the hit musical saga, and Daniel Sánchez Arévalo’s “Rondallas,” a Studiocanal-Bambú dramedy distributed by Beta Fiction Spain.

Senior Music Writer and Chief Music Critic
It may not yet be time to stop believin’, but the band Journey is announcing plans to hang it up after a farewell tour. An exact end date is not being announced, but the veteran group will mark the beginning of the end by embarkig next year on what is billed as the “first leg” of its final outing, with 60 dates scheduled in North American arenas from late February through early July.
The first show of the AEG-promoted “Final Frontier Tour 2026” will take place Feb. 28 in Hershey, Penn., with the tour continuing through July 2 in Laredo, Texas. No word was given on when a second leg might take place, although Neal Schon has previously stated this lineup would tour into 2027. (Scroll down for the full list of newly announced shows.) Tickets go on sale next week.

The announcement of a farewell tour brings at least some clarity to the future of the group, after confusion arose amid statements ade on social media in early October by Neal Schon. The guitarist indicated that Jonathan Cain , the only other remaining member from the group’s classic lineup, was headed for the exit, but then Schon clarified that Cain only planned to leave after a 2026-27 tour. No mention was made then that such a tour would be the last for the entire lineup. Popular on Variety
“As its founding member, I carry the Journey torch to this day, wherever I go,” Schon said in a statement. “The sentiment and spirit of the band will always remain. While this marks a farewell to one powerful chapter of the Journey we’ve shared, I want everyone to know I’m not done. Music is still burning strong inside me, and there are new creative horizons ahead. This tour is both a thank you and the beginning of what’s next.”
The tour itinerary passes over some primary markets like Southern California and New York City, no doubt being saved for a yet-to-be-revealed second leg. But the routing does include major cities like Pittsburgh, Montreal, Vancouver, Kansas City, Atlantic City, New Orleans, Austin, Des Moines, Sacramento, Buffalo and Washington, D.C., as markets that will apparently be getting their last shot at seeing a Journey show in the first half of the year.
Citi cardholders will be able to purchase presale tickets in the U.S. beginning Nov. 11 at 10 a.m. local time. The general on-sale starts Nov. 14 at 10 a.m. local time.
Cain offered his own statement as part of the tour announcement. “It’s been an incredible ride,” said the keyboard player. “We’ve shared our music with millions and this tour is about gratitude, connection and one last chance to feel that magic together. We wouldn’t want it any other way.”
Schon and Cain are apparently of the same mind about bringing Journey to a close now, though that didn’t necessarily appear to be the case a month ago. In a post on X Oct. 9, Schon wrote, “Jonathan Cain announced his farewell to Journey tonight. I’m nowhere near done! Journey has so much more life ahead! I’m sure we will have a great tour!” In a subsequent answer to a fan’s question, Schon added, “He wants to do his ministry.”
Following that, a spokesperson for Cain spoke up, saying the keyboard player “remains an active member of Journey, and any reports suggesting otherwise are inaccurate. He is fully dedicated to touring with the band over the next couple of years and has only expressed plans to retire at a later time.” Then Schon further clarified: “Jon is playing. He’s saying at the end of 26-27 he will move on. We will have a great couple of years.”
Schon and Cain have been publicly at odds, legally or otherwise, over different issues at many points in recent years, from credit card use to whether to visit the White House, though that has not stood in the way of an often vigorous touring regimen. Journey has remained a strong concert draw decades after the departure of singer Steve Perry, as Arnel Pineda has proven to be a popular substitute for millions of fans since he began performing with the band in 2008.
“I’m honored to be part of this legacy and I’m grateful for having been welcomed with such open arms,” said Pineda in a statement. “Every night on stage has been a dream come true.”
Both Schon and Cain are members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as Journey members. As he indicates in his quote, Schon was part of the founding lineup in 1973, four years even before Perry became its singer. Cain, formerly of the Babys, came aboard in 1980, in time for their seventh and biggest studio album, 1981’s diamond-certified “Escape,” earning co-writing as well as playing credits on hits like “Don’t Stop Believin’.”
The current lineup is rounded out by drummer Deen Castronovo, whose tenure dates back to 1998; keyboard player Jason Derlatka, who joined in 2020; and bassist Todd Jensen, who came aboard shortly after that. (The latter two replaced late-’70s-era mainstays Steve Smith and Ross Valory, who were fired and sued by Schon and Cain over an “attempted coup,” then countersued, before all parties reached an out-of-court settlement.)

Previously, James Donato, Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that Google had to allow third-party app stores to be distributed via Google Play.

Senior Entertainment Writer
When Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi first auditioned for “ Predator: Badlands ,” he didn’t know he was trying out to play the first of the titular aliens to be the hero, instead of a villain, in the 38-year-old franchise. In fact, he didn’t know he was auditioning for a “Predator” film at all. He wasn’t even provided with any written lines.
“All it said was ‘a creature,’” Schuster-Koloamatangi says. “The little character brief just said, ‘It’s all up to your interpretation.’” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
The 24-year-old actor has had to rely on his own imagination. As a kid in Auckland, New Zealand, he relished going to his local cinema and drank in movies as often as he could. But as the child of a Tongan father and Samoan mother, “I grew up not really seeing too many Polynesians on screen,” he says. “I didn’t think it was possible, to be honest, to have a brown face on screen, especially from my end of the world.” Popular on Variety
Instead, as part of a family of athletes, Schuster-Koloamatangi saw rugby as a possible career path. “Growing up, it’s either rugby or go to university and get a nine to five,” he says. “Acting was never, never something I thought was even possible.”
Even so, he found himself drawn to performing. In middle school, he started his own YouTube channel — until it was taken down for copyright infringement (which he didn’t know at the time would be an issue). In high school, he acted in school plays and took a media studies course his final year, where he met two Tongan filmmakers and peppered them with questions. A few months later, they called him in to audition for a small role in a New Zealand miniseries about a Kiwi rugby player. He nailed it.
“It was only, like, three scenes, and my character died,” he says. But from there he landed an agent, and then the lead role in the 2021 miniseries “The Panthers,” about a group of Polynesian youths who form their own political movement inspired by the American Black Panther Party. It was then “the switch started.”
“I’ve never been good at anything off the bat,” he says. “I’ve always just kind of been average or below average, so I’ve had to really work at things to be good. It’s cultivated just a ruthless work ethic.” He took acting courses to hone his craft and dedicated himself to the profession.
“I have big ideas,” he says, breaking into an infectious grin. “When I decided fully that this is the career path that I want to chase, it came with a lot of big visions. … I see myself going to the Oscars. I see myself with all the top players. I see myself being on the biggest stage possible. And I’ll get there somehow.”
With his performance in “Predator: Badlands,” Schuster-Koloamatangi has taken his first big step into that spotlight. He plays Dek, a young member of the alien species known as Yautja who is cast out by his father for being the “runt” of the clan. To prove himself, Dek travels to Genna — known as one of the deadliest planets in the galaxy due to its profusion of lethal animal and plant life — so he can hunt and kill the Kalisk, understood to be an unkillable predator in its own right.
Because the role is so intensely physical, for Schuster-Koloamatangi’s second audition, director Dan Trachtenberg (who also helmed the 2022 “Predator” prequel film “Prey” and the animated feature “Predator: Killer of Killers,” released in June) had the actor tackle an obstacle course with a team of stunt performers — some of whom were also gunning for the part.
“The way Dimitrius moved was so cool, so ferocious — so much cooler than the stuntmen were doing it, frankly,” Trachtenberg says. “What I was not prepared for was him throwing down on set and really being incredibly powerful and intense. He just insanely elevated the movie far past what we could have expected.”
Schuster-Koloamatangi’s only co-star, Elle Fanning, plays Thia, an android who’s been stranded on Genna without her legs. Dek carries her on his back for most of the film. It’s a fitting metaphor for the task that faced Schuster-Koloamatangi, who has the weight of the entire film on his fearsome shoulders, in a performance delivered entirely in the invented Yautja language, wearing a full Yautja body suit with his face replaced via performance capture CGI.
He spoke with Variety about his unconventional audition process, the how he bonded — literally and figuratively — with Fanning, the experience of shooting in his home country and how he mastered the Yautja language.
I had to do one in English, one in an alien language that’s up to you to make up. I had a lot of fun just remixing Samoan and Tongan and gibberish. From there, I got a call back, and it was an obstacle course. I was like, what is this job?
Because I am competitive, I had to keep reminding myself, “It’s not a race.” I had to keep slowing down to focus on performance, just show as much creature as I could. They had been drip feeding us information throughout. I was finding out, like, the director is Dan Trachtenberg, the studio is [20th Century]. I was doing a little research in the background, like, “Wait, this could be Predator, but I’m not sure.” So I just took a swing and was aiming my performance towards a Predator-like creature. I think it worked.
No, that was my first time. I was like, “What am I even doing here?” They had stunt men hanging around doing flips and whatnot. The people that I was auditioning with, a few of them were stunt people that had been in the game for a long time. It would have been easy to kind of overthink it. But I don’t know. I grew up playing sports and just having the mindset, “You’re supposed to be here.” Not getting too caught up in imposter syndrome, you know? Just give it your best. If it doesn’t work out, it’s not mean to be. But it was really exciting. I felt like I was in “Wipeout.” I was just missing the big red balls. It was cool, man.
So that’s funny, too. The first read through of the script, I saw that Dek carries Thia on his backpack, and I was like, “This is a great idea, but this will be like, CGI, right? This isn’t actually going to be a thing because she has legs in real life.” But with Dan, he can make anything a reality. We were rehearsing with the stunt team for a month all the different rigs that they had come up with to carry Elle on my back. It worked really well. Elle’s legs were in a sling. They both had us in harnesses. When we were strapped up, we couldn’t get ourselves out. Someone had to unscrew us to release us. It was a massive learning process. They were making up rigs on the spot to accommodate the both of us. I think it adds texture to the film, and it makes it feel real and authentic. You can see it on Dek’s face.
It happened so naturally that I couldn’t even tell you when exactly we just started clicking. I had my reservations a little bit before meeting her. She’s a massive name, and with that comes a little bit of uncertainty on how she might be. But Dan said that Elle was really down to earth and lovely to work with, and from the first second of properly talking to her, I could tell she was going to be a breeze. Once we were strapped up, I was always checking in and making sure she was good, and I think she really appreciated that. So the trust formed quite fast.
We had literal hours strapped together. A lot of the time they would just leave us strapped because it was too much time and effort to release us while they moved around cameras. There would be days where we just stayed linked up and would just talk about random things.
Oh man, those were the worst. In the suit, you can’t really get in and out too easy. So I’m kind of cramped up in the bathroom stall. My body’s in a C shape, trying to track the aim. It was a whole process. If someone had a camera in there, they would make a lot of money from the positions I tried to be in to go to the bathroom.
I thought I wouldn’t have to learn any lines because in the audition process — they were like, “Make up a language.” So I was like, “Man, I can just freestyle the whole time. This is great!” Later on, they told me I had to learn a whole language. So that was fun.
I was on Zoom calls with the linguist, probably three to four times a week the month before [filming]. When I wasn’t doing stunt work and training, I was at home, drilling the language over and over. That’s the only way to learn any language. You just have to fully immerse yourself in it. And because it was constructed like a real language, there was a lot of material that Britton had come up with to learn. I’d just have it in the car when I’m driving everywhere, on my speaker at home, when I’m chilling, practicing. The clicking with the throat was probably the hardest just get my head around, because you have to breathe out while breathing in at the same time. It was just getting my mouth and my throat used to those movements, and a lot of honey ginger teas.
The majority of the time was in the language. There would be a few days where we’d get new lines, like, 10 minutes before we shot, and we couldn’t get the translation fast enough from Britton, so those would have to be shot in English and then later [recorded] again in Yautja.
I was very proud to show off my backyard. You’d hear all the Americans raving about the landscape, and I’m standing there like, “Yeah, this is standard” — but in actuality, I hadn’t been to some of these locations before and I was just as in awe. Hūnua Falls, Bethells Beach, the Redwoods in Rotorua — these were all places that I had never been before, even though it was my home. A lot of locals don’t really take the time to see their own country. They always feel like they have to sightsee somewhere else. I was very blessed and fortunate because of the access the film gave us. If it wasn’t for the shooting, I wouldn’t even be allowed in some of these places that are blocked off to the public.
I only just watched the full cut when we were in London for the premiere. I hadn’t seen any cuts with CGI when I started doing ADR. It was just still my face. So I didn’t really know if this was going to work. I worked really hard on the Predator’s animalistic and primal behaviors, that presence that he has in all the previous films. But at the same time, I was also trying to inject my own unique flavor to Dek — they shouldn’t all look and be the same.
But once I saw all of the finished product, it was so cool to see. And it was really cool to be able to separate myself from it as well. A lot of the times when I’m watching things that I’m in, I can’t help but just nitpick at things. But since it looks like an alien, I can just watch the story and fully invest, like an audience member.
It sounds really bad, but I think because I’ve seen it so clearly in my mind before that it didn’t really come as too much as a surprise. The best thing that has come out of this year was I was able to bring my family to the premiere in L.A., and they got to see me work. None of them are in the industry, so none of them really know anything about what I do. I’ll go home and tell them, like, “Work was good,” but they didn’t really know even what to ask.
I’m working on a local New Zealand film at the moment. I land on Saturday back home. I go into rehearsals on Sunday and then we start shooting on Monday. I get to get back to my roots a little bit. It follows a young Tongan immigrant who is trying to make a living for himself back in the ’90s. It goes from a comedy-drama to a thriller. I’m really excited for it. I get to play human for this one, which is great.

Executive Editor
Lionsgate , which recently spun off its film and television studio from Starz, announced its quarterly earnings on Thursday, while the company’s CEO continued to praise the potential of AI in his public remarks to Wall Street.
Revenues at the studio behind “Ghosts” and “Hunger Games” hit  $475.1 million, a 21.3% decrease from the year-ago period when Lionsgate reported revenue of $604 million. Lionsgate logged an operating loss of $46 million, down from a loss of $100.7 million in the prior-year period. Net losses shrank to $113.5 million, compared to a $163.3 million loss over the same quarter in 2024.  Netflix’s earnings per-share logged a 39 cent loss, compared to a loss of 68 cents in the prior-year span.

In 2024, Lionsgate announced a deal with Runway to train an AI model on the company’s library of content, which the studio would then use to develop new material. In an earnings call with analysts, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said: “We continue to find exciting new use cases as we apply AI to more areas of our business, increasing our productivity, generating cost savings and expanding our creative tool kit.” The Lionsgate chief did stress that he was only in favor of AI if “appropriate guardrails are established” and if copyrighted material isn’t exploited without the consent of rights holders. Popular on Variety
During the most recent quarter, motion picture segment revenue of $276.4 million decreased from $409.4 million. The company said the decline was due to the fact that it released five wide theatrical releases during the year-ago period compared to two wide theatrical releases, “ The Long Walk ” and “The Strangers – Chapter 2,” over the three-month span ending in September. Segment profit of $30.5 million improved from the $1.7 million in profits that the division logged in the same period in 2024.
On the TV front, segment revenue declined to $198.7 million from $416.6 million in the prior-year period, while segment profit of $12.5 million was down from $24.4 million in the prior-year period. Lionsgate, which produced an adaptation of John Grisham’s “The Rainmaker” during the three-month stretch, said the decline in profits and revenues “reflects the timing of episodic deliveries, some of which pushed into the second half of the fiscal year.”
Lionsgate has struggled at the box office in recent years, but the studio is hoping that an upcoming slate that includes a return to Panem with “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping” and “Michael,” a biopic of Michael Jackson, will help it recapture its stride. The company also recently announced a deal with Millennium to acquire all future film and TV rights to “The Expendables” franchise, as well as worldwide distribution rights to the next “Rambo” movie.
Shares of Lionsgate were down more than 7% in after-hours trading.

The team behind global family hits “Mia and the White Lion” and “The Wolf and the Lion,” Mediawan ‘s Mai Juin Productions, is heading back into the wild with “Indiana and the Otters’ Legend.”
Set to shoot in the wilds of Canada’s Eastern Townships in 2026, the English-language family adventure project has been boarded by Playtime , the Paris-based company which is part of Vuelta. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Playtime (“The Quiet Son”) is launching worldwide sales for the ambitious project at the American Film Market, marking its first collaboration with Mai Juin Productions. Popular on Variety
Following the journey of animals and children set against against a lush backdrop, “Indiana and the Otters’ Legend” has already secured distribution partners in major territories, including another Vuelta-affiliated banner, Pan Distribution in France, as well as Mediawan’s Leonine Studios in Germany, and Photon Films and TVA Films in Canada.
The new movie, penned by Cynthia Knight, will mark the debut film of Julien Decoin, who has been an assistant director for 20 years, contributing to films such as “Final Cut,” “The Wolf and the Lion” and “Someone, Somewhere.”
Marguerite Laurence, who was seen in “Miss Boots,” stars in a first lead role as 12-year-old Indiana (Laurence), who is “uprooted from the city to the struggling riverside town of Otterville — once famous for its otters, now hauntingly without them. When two unexpectedly return, the town dares to hope again. But protecting them leads Indiana and her friends into a battle against a predatory developer, a corrupt mayor, and her own father — the town sheriff,” reads the synopsis.
Mai Juin Productions’ Catherine Camborde, the driving force behind the animal-led family hits, “Mia and the White Lion” ($40M), “The Wolf and the Lion” ($25M) and “The Last Jaguar” ($22M), is producing “Indiana and the Otters Legend,” alongside Wishing Tree Productions’ Jonathan Vanger and Sylvain Proulx, whose credits span “Cat & Dog,” “Best Sellers,” and “Crisis”. The project is backed by Telefilm Canada.
“Otters as the main characters are highly engaging,” said Playtime Co-CEO Sébastien Beffa. “They bring an imaginary background of positive values such as family and work, but also tenderness, humor, and genuine empathy.”
Beffa also praised the script for offering an “authentic ecological perspective, not in a guilt-inducing way but in a constructive manner, allowing audiences of all ages to get involved in an entertaining way.”
Camborde and Vanger, meanwhile, said they’re “delighted with this first partnership with Playtime.
The pair described “Indiana and the Otters Legend” as “an adventure film in the spirit of ‘E.T.,’ ‘Super 8,’ ‘The Goonies’ and ‘Stranger Things,’ featuring a group of children and otters.” The producers said the film will combine “adventure, emotion, and comedy thanks to the mischievous nature of the animals,” and universal themes such as ” friendship, teenage emancipation, environmental protection.”

By Cynthia Littleton
Business Editor
Sean Astin came into his new role as president of SAG-AFTRA with a big agenda. Days after he was elected in September, his to-do list got even longer when the Jimmy Kimmel-ABC crisis erupted, followed by the arrival of AI ingenue Tilly Norwood and the Sora 2 flap involving Bryan Cranston.
Plus, in his first weeks of discussions with the union’s staff, Astin became more aware of problems involving auditions and casting directors. And the perennial issue of access to the union’s health care plan has only become more acute for members, particularly older members, given the turbulence in Hollywood’s job market. Popular on Variety Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
In his first extended interview since taking the SAG-AFTRA reins from Fran Drescher, Astin dove in with candid responses to questions including the overarching question about next year’s negotiations on a master contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Highlights from the interview are also featured on today’s episode of the “Daily Variety” podcast.
The last time around, in 2023, those bargaining sessions cratered into a five-month strike that marked SAG-AFTRA’s first industry-wide work stoppage since 1980. Nearly three years later, Astin brings the can-do energy of a working actor. He was born into the thespian life as the son of actors Patty Duke, who served as president of what was then the Screen Actors Guild from 1985 to 1988, and John Astin of “The Addams Family” fame.
Well, my approach coming in was going to be to spend a month or two looking inward and really try and understand from the president’s office things that you don’t necessarily have access to, even if you’re on the board. It’s just amazing how quickly world events and industry-wide events seem to grab a hold of my focus. Jimmy Kimmel was fired from his job…
Well, yes, I suppose that’s an important legal nuance, but if you’re Jimmy Kimmel or anyone on that show, it sure feels like a firing when the government threatens you and then you are treated by your affiliates in a manner that is less than cordial or consistent with your contract. So in other situations like that, we haven’t spoken up as much because the rationale given by the producers or the companies or whatever have been somewhat more credible, but this was a situation where the government had specifically intervened with a threat.
He’s working under a SAG-AFTRA contract, on a SAG-AFTRA set. We were very careful not to level our comments at the very beginning above the affiliates. The affiliates were ones that were making the decisions they made and they were improper. So we tried to focus our comments on that. I think our union has a slightly different posture when it comes to speaking out on these issues, because we are very recognizable to the public, and so when we say things and when our organization makes public commentary, we have to make sure that our reputation can stand behind it, and it did in that scenario. People were out in the streets, and individual members were protesting as well. That was just the first week! Then the Tilly Norwood thing comes out. It was almost a helpful moment in articulating why there should be such strong pushback against industry and and tech, because it was framed as though this artificial construct, this fictional character that was created was going to cause some sort of uproar in the agency business, and whether or not the agents were going to be representing her. Because it’s an old school narrative. It’s a great trope, you know, a young ingenue is discovered and becomes a big star, and all this stuff. And it was, but it’s all fake. It was all fake, and it was all engineered. So I just thought it was a fantastic opportunity to be able to see that the public was focusing its attention on this, and help direct that attention from the perspective of performers who are not going to be displaced.
It requires absolute focus to protect our workforce. You know, it wasn’t a threat in the way that it was being marketed, that agents were all of a sudden going to begin, I guess, moving out of the talent representation business and into the synthetic data management business. But the actual technology itself, the idea of artificial intelligence and synthetic creations that are lifelike and seem real — that’s an absolute threat. We’ve seen that coming for a long time, but I really appreciate what you said, because at SAG-AFTRA, we are in the vanguard. We are the absolute industry leaders at helping to shape policy in this space, at least in the entertainment space. Our lawyers help draft the language that’s in some of these AI protection bills.
And Governor [Gavin] Newsom came to our building, 5757 Wilshire, to sign a couple of pieces of legislation that we were influential in helping to move into law. I’m proud of it because I’ve seen it in action. But I also did a congressional round table with [House member] Darrell Issa in downtown L.A. They had one of those mobile congressional hearings, and I was the only labor representative at a table that was filled with general counsels. And it was interesting that when I was speaking about human-centered performance and the need to protect not just our name, image and likeness, not just our right of publicity, but our very dignity, our humanness — that which makes us us. These lawyers who are very skilled people at keeping a poker face, they were nodding yes. There’s a lot of overlap in what it means to protect our information, our data, their libraries, our identities. And so in bargaining I’m sure there will continue to be a very robust exchange about what next steps there are to take.
Data tracking. Data tracking.
I mean, listen, I’m just one person, and my role as president is to help guide a team to a great conclusion about whatever proposal packet we want to bring across. But I’ll be in the room arguing very vigorously for whatever is the most up to date. You used to hear about watermarking. You hear about blockchain technology. The basic premise of what I want to see as a lay person is [to address] the lie that when things are ingested into their large models, they can’t track them. That’s a lie. They lied about it before. If they lie about it again, we’re going to call them on that lie. I don’t generally like calling people a liar, but we absolutely know now that data can be tracked. They may not want it to be tracked, because once they realize on the other side, when a digital creator is put together, they may realize that there are a number of, I don’t even know how many performers’ work, that has been ingested and spit out, so that just seems to me like the lowest hanging fruit in terms of, conceptually, what we want to be able to do. But I am not the expert in knowing how we’re going to attack the AI argument. What I do know is that I’m going to help manage a team of experts so that when we get to that moment, there shouldn’t be any surprise when we walk into that room, everybody should know exactly what’s at stake. And I hope that we can work together, that we can work together to design something, because we all know what’s needed.
Open AI, we had one of our members, Bryan Cranston…
So we did not invent this moment, but we are living in it. And when the Tilly Norwood thing happened, and we saw the pushback, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, our national executive director and chief negotiator, and I penned a letter to our members. It took a lot of time. But we felt that it was important to really invest the right kind of time and energy to compose a communication that level-set to our members, where their leadership sees this moment, and it got a wonderful response. Members really seem to appreciate the time we took and what we said, the positions we laid out. I’m sure some would feel that it doesn’t go far enough, but the response was really wonderful. I had just made a movie with Bryan Cranston in the summer called “Chili Finger” with John Goodman, Judy Greer and myself, and we just had a great time. It’s gonna be a great little movie.
[Cranston] called me or sent me a text or something like that. Right after he read that, he said that letter is incredible, Sean, that’s really, really great. Thank you so much for writing. Is it gives me so much comfort. And I said, “Oh, thanks, man, how are you?” His next email came back saying, “I just got contacted by a reporter” because Walter White, his famous character from “Breaking Bad,” appeared on a street corner with Michael Jackson in some amusing [AI-created] way. And he put the link in there, and I looked at it, and I was like, I thought, Wow. He said, “I don’t want to answer the questions until I’ve talked to my union and I know that whatever our approach is, and that I’m working in concert with what the union’s approach is.” It makes me want to cry because for someone of his level of success and familiarity with the public, his voice carries very far and for his first instinct to be check with the union. I just thought, man, I hope that a lot of the other union members that we have think about that.
So we were ready to fight. But then our policy making team said, “Well, actually, OpenAI has said that they they’re going to change their opt-out to opt-in.” The opt-out thing is the most ludicrous piece of garbage I had ever heard in my life. This is where if you somehow happen to find somewhere in the ether that your likeness has been used, you can try and find a phone number for somebody at whatever company is using it, and say “Would you please mind not using my image,” and that just seemed criminal to me. But apparently, [OpenAI CEO] Sam Altman and OpenAI had said previously that they’re going to change that to an opt-in process, which is they won’t use it unless they’ve asked you and you’ve agreed to use it, which essentially is what we have in our contract right now. You just have to notify us and get our permission and pay us. But we were unsure of some of the language that was used. But at this moment, they were really indicating to us that they wanted to cooperate, and it just became clear to me that it’s in their interest to cooperate with us.
Some of the public has a discerning curiosity about what it is that they’re being exposed to. And nobody likes to be tricked. Nobody likes to have an experience that they have an emotional relationship to and then be told, Oh yeah, by the way, that was a construct that you didn’t know was operating on you. So I feel like you know. They were willing to support our [proposed federal] No Fakes legislation. I mean the whole industry, not just SAG-AFTRA. Everybody’s trying to get this No Fakes Act through. And when they said they would support it I said “Let’s do a joint statement then.” And everybody got excited about it. So I don’t want to over-praise the moment, but the fact that they took it down and said they didn’t want to do that in the future, and would support the AI safety legislation we were pursuing, that seemed like a good way to find collaboration with them. I hope there’s a lot more of that in the future.
Lots of anecdotal information. I’m unsatisfied with that. I want to see analytics. You know, they want an AI waiver from us. Our lawyers talk to me about the importance of focusing on usage, and I honestly don’t know how many claims have been made in this space yet, or where that process is. I’m not sure what the disclosure protocols are for talking about that. But I fully expect that it will be tested, that all these things that we have put into place will be tested. Again, it’s just the start.
Personally, I do. I think the issue in doubt is whether it will, in fact, scale in this country the way it did in China. But our members were working in this space, and it was really important for us to create the same safety mechanisms for them that people have working elsewhere, because it’s professional work. It was not an easy thing to organize the verticals space. Our folks are experts, and they work a lot of elbow grease to identify the different producers who are doing this content and helping them understand what a union contract is, helping them understand what it’s like to function in a production space, conforming to certain basic kind of reporting and payment and other things that you got to do if you’re a signatory company. So hats off to our group for recognizing how important it was to get that contract out as quickly as possible. It’s a promulgated contract, which means that it’s a one-off.
Well, we have this big contract negotiation coming up, which is that matter, they’re going to take a lot of passion and hard work to make sure that we that we function as responsibly and with as much strength as the moment warrants. In the casting space, there’s a lot of bad practices that happen, including finding ways to charge our performers or their representatives. They and the companies would have our union believe that there’s no relationship between the companies and the casting directors. That’s not true. The companies pay the casting directors for their work, so we just need to address this unholy triangle between the representatives, the casting agencies and the companies. I want to do whatever I can working with our team to help create a smoother roadmap, which I think will be in everyone’s interest, frankly.
I would say the two things I hear about the most from members is AI, but the other is health and pension. We still have a dreadful situation, based on the changes that were made in the health plan four or five years ago, when a lot of seniors were pushed off the plan.
Well, the whole country. The cost of healthcare in America is just out of control. But, you know, we make certain moral commitments to our members, and to the extent that it’s possible we would like to try and live up to those, he says with 47,000 exclamation points on the end of it.
I do want any of our members who are reading this to know that their leadership knows that there’s a problem and is focused on it so and you know, I think that’s probably true of most unions around the country, frankly, because we’re all existing in an environment where the cost of healthcare and pharmacy drugs and stuff is just out of control. But to the extent where we can, I’ll try my best to have as positive an impact on the situation as I can.

By Cynthia Littleton

Sean Astin came into his new role as president of SAG-AFTRA with a big agenda. Days after he was elected in September, his to-do list got even longer when the Jimmy Kimmel-ABC crisis erupted, followed by the arrival of AI ingenue Tilly Norwood and the Sora 2 flap involving Bryan Cranston.
Plus, in his first weeks of discussions with the union’s staff, Astin became more aware of problems involving auditions and casting directors. And the perennial issue of access to the union’s health care plan has only become more acute for members, particularly older members, given the turbulence in Hollywood’s job market.

In his first extended interview since taking the SAG-AFTRA reins from Fran Drescher, Astin dove in with candid responses to questions including the overarching question about next year’s negotiations on a master contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Highlights from the interview are also featured on today’s episode of the “Daily Variety” podcast.
The last time around, in 2023, those bargaining sessions cratered into a five-month strike that marked SAG-AFTRA’s first industry-wide work stoppage since 1980. Nearly three years later, Astin brings the can-do energy of a working actor. He was born into the thespian life as the son of actors Patty Duke, who served as president of what was then the Screen Actors Guild from 1985 to 1988, and John Astin of “The Addams Family” fame.
Well, my approach coming in was going to be to spend a month or two looking inward and really try and understand from the president’s office things that you don’t necessarily have access to, even if you’re on the board. It’s just amazing how quickly world events and industry-wide events seem to grab a hold of my focus. Jimmy Kimmel was fired from his job…
Well, yes, I suppose that’s an important legal nuance, but if you’re Jimmy Kimmel or anyone on that show, it sure feels like a firing when the government threatens you and then you are treated by your affiliates in a manner that is less than cordial or consistent with your contract. So in other situations like that, we haven’t spoken up as much because the rationale given by the producers or the companies or whatever have been somewhat more credible, but this was a situation where the government had specifically intervened with a threat.
He’s working under a SAG-AFTRA contract, on a SAG-AFTRA set. We were very careful not to level our comments at the very beginning above the affiliates. The affiliates were ones that were making the decisions they made and they were improper. So we tried to focus our comments on that. I think our union has a slightly different posture when it comes to speaking out on these issues, because we are very recognizable to the public, and so when we say things and when our organization makes public commentary, we have to make sure that our reputation can stand behind it, and it did in that scenario. People were out in the streets, and individual members were protesting as well. That was just the first week! Then the Tilly Norwood thing comes out. It was almost a helpful moment in articulating why there should be such strong pushback against industry and and tech, because it was framed as though this artificial construct, this fictional character that was created was going to cause some sort of uproar in the agency business, and whether or not the agents were going to be representing her. Because it’s an old school narrative. It’s a great trope, you know, a young ingenue is discovered and becomes a big star, and all this stuff. And it was, but it’s all fake. It was all fake, and it was all engineered. So I just thought it was a fantastic opportunity to be able to see that the public was focusing its attention on this, and help direct that attention from the perspective of performers who are not going to be displaced.
It requires absolute focus to protect our workforce. You know, it wasn’t a threat in the way that it was being marketed, that agents were all of a sudden going to begin, I guess, moving out of the talent representation business and into the synthetic data management business. But the actual technology itself, the idea of artificial intelligence and synthetic creations that are lifelike and seem real — that’s an absolute threat. We’ve seen that coming for a long time, but I really appreciate what you said, because at SAG-AFTRA, we are in the vanguard. We are the absolute industry leaders at helping to shape policy in this space, at least in the entertainment space. Our lawyers help draft the language that’s in some of these AI protection bills.
And Governor [Gavin] Newsom came to our building, 5757 Wilshire, to sign a couple of pieces of legislation that we were influential in helping to move into law. I’m proud of it because I’ve seen it in action. But I also did a congressional round table with [House member] Darrell Issa in downtown L.A. They had one of those mobile congressional hearings, and I was the only labor representative at a table that was filled with general counsels. And it was interesting that when I was speaking about human-centered performance and the need to protect not just our name, image and likeness, not just our right of publicity, but our very dignity, our humanness — that which makes us us. These lawyers who are very skilled people at keeping a poker face, they were nodding yes. There’s a lot of overlap in what it means to protect our information, our data, their libraries, our identities. And so in bargaining I’m sure there will continue to be a very robust exchange about what next steps there are to take.
Data tracking. Data tracking.
I mean, listen, I’m just one person, and my role as president is to help guide a team to a great conclusion about whatever proposal packet we want to bring across. But I’ll be in the room arguing very vigorously for whatever is the most up to date. You used to hear about watermarking. You hear about blockchain technology. The basic premise of what I want to see as a lay person is [to address] the lie that when things are ingested into their large models, they can’t track them. That’s a lie. They lied about it before. If they lie about it again, we’re going to call them on that lie. I don’t generally like calling people a liar, but we absolutely know now that data can be tracked. They may not want it to be tracked, because once they realize on the other side, when a digital creator is put together, they may realize that there are a number of, I don’t even know how many performers’ work, that has been ingested and spit out, so that just seems to me like the lowest hanging fruit in terms of, conceptually, what we want to be able to do. But I am not the expert in knowing how we’re going to attack the AI argument. What I do know is that I’m going to help manage a team of experts so that when we get to that moment, there shouldn’t be any surprise when we walk into that room, everybody should know exactly what’s at stake. And I hope that we can work together, that we can work together to design something, because we all know what’s needed.
Open AI, we had one of our members, Bryan Cranston…
So we did not invent this moment, but we are living in it. And when the Tilly Norwood thing happened, and we saw the pushback, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, our national executive director and chief negotiator, and I penned a letter to our members. It took a lot of time. But we felt that it was important to really invest the right kind of time and energy to compose a communication that level-set to our members, where their leadership sees this moment, and it got a wonderful response. Members really seem to appreciate the time we took and what we said, the positions we laid out. I’m sure some would feel that it doesn’t go far enough, but the response was really wonderful. I had just made a movie with Bryan Cranston in the summer called “Chili Finger” with John Goodman, Judy Greer and myself, and we just had a great time. It’s gonna be a great little movie.
[Cranston] called me or sent me a text or something like that. Right after he read that, he said that letter is incredible, Sean, that’s really, really great. Thank you so much for writing. Is it gives me so much comfort. And I said, “Oh, thanks, man, how are you?” His next email came back saying, “I just got contacted by a reporter” because Walter White, his famous character from “Breaking Bad,” appeared on a street corner with Michael Jackson in some amusing [AI-created] way. And he put the link in there, and I looked at it, and I was like, I thought, Wow. He said, “I don’t want to answer the questions until I’ve talked to my union and I know that whatever our approach is, and that I’m working in concert with what the union’s approach is.” It makes me want to cry because for someone of his level of success and familiarity with the public, his voice carries very far and for his first instinct to be check with the union. I just thought, man, I hope that a lot of the other union members that we have think about that.
So we were ready to fight. But then our policy making team said, “Well, actually, OpenAI has said that they they’re going to change their opt-out to opt-in.” The opt-out thing is the most ludicrous piece of garbage I had ever heard in my life. This is where if you somehow happen to find somewhere in the ether that your likeness has been used, you can try and find a phone number for somebody at whatever company is using it, and say “Would you please mind not using my image,” and that just seemed criminal to me. But apparently, [OpenAI CEO] Sam Altman and OpenAI had said previously that they’re going to change that to an opt-in process, which is they won’t use it unless they’ve asked you and you’ve agreed to use it, which essentially is what we have in our contract right now. You just have to notify us and get our permission and pay us. But we were unsure of some of the language that was used. But at this moment, they were really indicating to us that they wanted to cooperate, and it just became clear to me that it’s in their interest to cooperate with us.
Some of the public has a discerning curiosity about what it is that they’re being exposed to. And nobody likes to be tricked. Nobody likes to have an experience that they have an emotional relationship to and then be told, Oh yeah, by the way, that was a construct that you didn’t know was operating on you.

By Todd Spangler
NY Digital Editor
Amazon said it will cut approximately 14,000 white-collar jobs, representing about 4% of the total corporate workforce, as it seeks to gain efficiencies — and as it prepares for advances in artificial intelligence that will reduce the number of humans needed to run the company.
Beth Galetti, SVP of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a memo to employees Tuesday that the layoffs are a continuation of the company’s efforts “to get even stronger by further reducing bureaucracy, removing layers, and shifting resources to ensure we’re investing in our biggest bets and what matters most to our customers’ current and future needs.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
On Monday, Reuters had reported that Amazon would cut as many as 30,000 employees to “pare expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic.” In her memo, Galetti indicated that the company anticipates making more layoffs next year. Popular on Variety
This past June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy telegraphed looming layoffs, saying that efficiency gains from using AI would cause the company to reduce its corporate workforce over the next few years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he wrote in an internal memo. “It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”
Galetti wrote in her memo Tuesday that “Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well.” For the second quarter of 2025, Amazon reported revenue of $167.7 billion (up 13%) and net income of $18.2 billion (up 35%), with both metrics comfortably topping Wall Street estimates . The ecommerce giant held $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the end of June.
According to Galetti, “What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”
In 2026, Galetti wrote, “as Andy talked about earlier this year, we expect to continue hiring in key strategic areas while also finding additional places we can remove layers, increase ownership, and realize efficiency gains.”
Amazon is scheduled to report Q3 2025 earnings Thursday, Oct. 30, after the market closes.

TV Business Writer
Nexstar reported its third-quarter 2025 earnings Thursday, revealing ad revenue was down 23.5% year over year during the July-September quarter.
Additionally, Nexstar says the CW network has narrowed its losses by 24% since the comparable period last year.
According to Nexstar, overall Q3 ad sales stood at $476 million, a decrease of $146 million from the third-quarter of 2024. Political ad revenue was $10 million, down $145 million, which Nexstar attributes to the current election cycle.

Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of $1.83 on $1.2 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG. Nexstar reported diluted EPS of $2.14 on $1.2 billion in revenue. Net revenue was down 12.3%, which Netflix primarily attributes to lower political ad sales. Popular on Variety
“In the third quarter, we took a major step forward in shaping Nexstar’s future as we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TEGNA Inc. for $6.2 billion in a highly accretive transaction,” Nexstar founder, chairman and CEO Perry Sook said in a letter to shareholders. “Operationally, our core business is performing well, with stable year-over-year distribution and non-political advertising revenue and strong expense management resulting in lower year-over-year operating expenses. In addition, we continued to progress our network growth strategies as NewsNation was, once again, the fastest growing cable network in the quarter, and The CW generated its sixth consecutive quarter of primetime ratings growth and reduced losses by 24% year-over-year. Looking forward, we are focused on completing our upcoming distribution renewals, closing our acquisition of TEGNA Inc., and capitalizing on the 2026 mid-term election political advertising opportunity, all of which we anticipate will drive shareholder value.”

Will AI lead to major job cuts in corporate America?
Here’s what OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot says: “The short answer is: AI will almost certainly cause some layoffs, but it’s unlikely to eliminate most jobs outright. Instead, it’s more likely to transform the nature of many roles and reshape the workforce over time.”
A nuanced take, perhaps. But there’s evidence that a long-speculated seismic shake-up of the U.S. labor force driven by AI is starting to happen. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Amazon last week announced the elimination of 14,000 corporate jobs , representing about 4% of its total white-collar workforce. A company HR exec cited rapid developments coming in AI , saying “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the internet.” In the next few years, the e-commerce giant forecasts a net reduction in its total corporate headcount “as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company,” CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a companywide memo in June. Popular on Variety
On Oct. 30, Jassy downplayed the AI job-destruction narrative . He told analysts on Amazon’s Q3 earnings call the cuts are “not even really AI-driven. Not right now at least.” What they are about, he said, is “culture,” saying Amazon’s fast growth has produced “more layers” of job functions that can be streamlined. Certainly, Amazon isn’t handing out pink slips because of dire financial stress: It reported total quarterly revenue of $180.2 billion (up 13%) and net income of $21.2 billion (up 38%).
Paramount Skydance also initiated layoffs last week, targeting about 2,000 job eliminations (10% of its total workforce) after the closure of Skydance Media’s $8 billion takeover of Paramount Global less than three months ago.
In a memo to staff about the cuts, chief David Ellison didn’t specifically mention AI; he said the reductions aimed to phase out “roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities.” But Ellison — son of Oracle multibillionaire Larry Ellison — has routinely espoused taking a tech-forward Silicon Valley approach to managing a major media company, by using big data and automation. Ellison has on multiple occasions said that he wants to “embrace AI.”
In a press briefing shortly after he clinched the Paramount pact in July 2024, Ellison said: “We view this time period as being pretty similar to some of the transitions that some of the traditional tech companies went through, such as Microsoft and Oracle, where they disrupted their own businesses to have all-time [stock] highs.”
Meanwhile, Google’s YouTube is anticipating AI-induced workforce reductions. AI is “the next frontier” for YouTube and “has the potential to transform every part of the platform,” CEO Neal Mohan wrote in a memo last week to staffers, announcing a major reorg of its product team geared around an AI-centric future.
“We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity,” Mohan said — and as part of the shift to AI, YouTube is introducing a “voluntary exit program” for employees . A spokesperson confirmed that YouTube is offering a buyout option with severance for U.S.-based workers but said no role eliminations or layoffs are part of the reorg.
AI superpowers are pumping billions of dollars into building data-processing factories. In reporting Q3 results, Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon each raised annual capex guidance to boost AI capacity, and they plan to continue spending heavily. Nvidia, the leading chipmaker for powering AI applications, last week became the first company to hit a $5 trillion market cap.
The dramatic impact of AI on employment is undeniable. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 found that 40% of employers expect to reduce their workforce where AI can automate tasks.   “Innovation” related to artificial intelligence could “displace” 6%-7% of the U.S. workforce in the coming years if AI is widely adopted, according to a research report from Goldman Sachs published in August 2025. However, the impact is likely to be “transitory as new job opportunities created by the technology ultimately put people to work in other capacities,” according to the report.
Most jobs at risk are entry-level, white-collar roles that can be performed more easily by computers, a World Economic Forum analysis found. The org cited research estimating that AI could replace 53% of the work done by market analysts and 67% of the tasks handled by sales reps.
But the robots are coming for many other lines of work. AI was a hot-button issue during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, as the unions feared studios would increasingly use the tech to eliminate jobs for flesh-and-blood humans. The unions ultimately won AI-related concessions from the studios in new contracts, including mandating explicit consent from actors for the use of “digital replicas.”
“AI can create a convincing simulation of a human actor, and the tech is improving at an alarming rate,” actor and filmmaker Justine Bateman, an adviser to SAG-AFTRA, told Variety at the time — two years before the hyperrealistic AI “actress” Tilly Norwood ignited an uproar after its U.K. creator said Norwood had secured talent-agency representation.
Of course, workers’ fears about machines making them obsolete date to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Techno-utopians point out that, historically, advancements have led to the explosion of huge new business sectors and jobs. Just one example: Google, which didn’t exist three decades ago, employed 190,167 people as of the end of September.
Some Hollywood leaders, including Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, have pushed the idea that AI is a net positive for creatives . “AI isn’t replacing storytellers — it’s creating tools that empower them to tell stories they never could before,” he said last month on an episode of the “Aspire With Emma Grede” podcast.
In the same breath, however, Sarandos wondered whether making a “$300 million or $400 million movie” makes sense if the “monetization model” doesn’t justify the math. Generative AI tools, the exec said, “can do a very similar thing for a more controllable price.” You can forgive workers in the moviemaking trenches for hearing that as code for job cuts.

Variety Editor at Large
Just when you thought there was nothing left to reboot , remake or revive, TV is riding a new wave of nostalgia. And this time, there’s a turn-of-the-century twist.
Shows from the late 1990s and early 2000s are back in play: “ Scrubs ,” which ran from 2001 to 2010, relaunches on ABC on Feb. 25 with new and returning cast members. Sarah Michelle Gellar returns as part of the “Buffy, the Vampire Slayer” (1997-2003) sequel series from Chloé Zhao, expected to premiere on Hulu in 2026. And Disney+ is behind the limited-series reunion of “ Malcolm in the Middle ” (2000-06), expected in the spring and featuring Bryan Cranston, Frankie Muniz and the rest of the original cast.

That’s just the top of the list of reboots and revivals in the works. Hulu just ordered to series a new version of “Prison Break” (2005-09, with a 2017 revisit), from Elgin James and starring Emily Browning. Kerry Washington is developing a new take on “Desperate Housewives,” dubbed “Wisteria Lane,” at Onyx Collective. The teams behind “blue sky” series like “White Collar” and “Royal Pains” are also attempting to revive their shows. And a “Community” movie has been greenlit by Peacock, though scheduling conflicts have held up production. Popular on Variety
These projects all join recent entries including a double shot from TV megaproducer Greg Daniels, whose updated take on “King of the Hill” (with Mike Judge) was met with rave reviews — and has just been renewed for two more seasons — while his “The Office” offshoot, “The Paper” (created with Michael Koman) did well for Peacock and premieres on NBC for a linear run this Monday.
What’s driving this trend, in part, is demographic shifts: As millennials hit middle age, they’re more interested in nostalgia for the shows from their youth. And their Gen Z children, who binged them on streaming, are intrigued too.
“Millennials are reaching that age where they’re watching things because they want to pass a lot of them to their kids, and they have a lot more force as a consumer group because of their size, as well as just having nostalgia for these things,” says former The WB president Jordan Levin, who was instrumental in programming for that age group when they were teens.
Reboots, remakes and revivals have been a part of the TV landscape since the beginning (think of the many iterations of “The Honeymooners,” “Dragnet” or later, “The Brady Bunch”). The idea of “getting the band back together” intensified in the multichannel age, as programmers leaned on familiar titles because their built-in awareness made them easier to market in a cluttered landscape.
Streaming in its early days was built on the backs of revivals: “Arrested Development,” “Fuller House” and “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” were early Netflix entries, while Hulu ramped up its slate with “Veronica Mars” and “Animaniacs” revisits, Peacock launched with “Punky Brewster,” “Saved by the Bell” and “Bel-Air” and Paramount+ came out of the gate with “The Real World” reunion seasons, new “Rugrats,” a return to “iCarly” and a new take on “The Twilight Zone.”
But it’s not easy to recapture the magic of the original — which is why the majority of these revivals don’t last more than a handful of seasons. The return of “Will & Grace” opened big in 2017 but quickly fizzled, as did attempts to bring back “Murphy Brown” and “Mad About You.” “Punky Brewster” and “Saved by the Bell” quickly went away, and more recently, “Frasier,” “That ’90s Show” and “Night Court” couldn’t go the distance. (CBS Studios tried to shop “Frasier” to other platforms after the show was canceled at Paramount+, but had no luck.)
“They’re never as good, and you can’t help but compare it to the original,” says one TV showrunner who has chosen not to reboot their show.
Series that have successfully been revived include “Roseanne,” which continued as “The Conners” for seven seasons even after Roseanne Barr was fired. In animation, besides the roaring return of “King of the Hill,” the new seasons of “Futurama” and “Phineas and Ferb” have also made a splash in their comebacks.
With so much stigma on trying to revive long-dormant shows, some stars and showrunners would rather just gather for a reunion special. “Friends” did one on HBO Max in 2021, while CBS just taped a 30th anniversary “Everybody Loves Raymond” event that will air on Nov. 24. And in January, the cast of “Married … With Children” is coming together onstage in Los Angeles for a non-televised reunion. Then there are the countless rewatch podcasts hosted by former stars of fan favorite shows.
Perhaps there’s a lesson somewhere that not everything needs a revival. “It fundamentally comes down to, is there a reason for it to be that is artistic?” says Levin. “Is there a purpose? Is there a catalyst for it that goes beyond simply economics and marketing and awareness? We certainly have seen underlying intellectual property that gets rebooted in a fresh way because someone takes it and makes it their own.”

Senior Music Writer and Chief Music Critic
For nearly the entirety of the “ Wicked: One Wonderful Night ” TV special, which aired on NBC Thursday night, the performances were focused on Stephen Schwartz’s songs from the two “Wicked” movies. But for the two-hour show’s climax, stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo veered deliciously off-topic to cover a medley of songs first made famous 62 years ago by Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland .
Some younger viewers may have been initially puzzled by the mashup, but fans of a certain age, or of a certain show-tune leaning, got it from the very first bar, or might have even dared to anticipate it when Erivo and Grande sat down on stools, side by side. It was the pairing of two distinct standards that both date back nearly a hundred years, “Get Happy” and “Happy Days Are Here Again.” The two classics have come to be conjoined in some people’s minds, but that is only because they were first sung that way by Garland and Streisand on a legendary episode of “The Judy Garland Show” in 1963.

The Judy/Barbra performance became the stuff of legend partly because it captured two legends at opposite ends of their careers. Streisand, then 21, was not only far from a superstar but hadn’t even done “Funny Girl” on Broadway yet — although she had earlier that year released her debut LP, “The Streisand Album,” which had as its Side 2 leadoff number “Happy Days Are Here Again.” That 1929 tune (written by Milton Ager and Jack Yellen) has remained a staple of her concerts (minus duets or interpolations) right up through her last tour in 2019. Popular on Variety
Garland was also singing a signature song for her half of the entwined duet — which was reportedly her idea, to jazz up the special. “Get Happy,” originally penned in 1930 (by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler), was a pseudo-gospel number she popularized in the 1950 MGM musical “Summer Stock” and continued to sing through the end of her life. Then 41, Garland was considered on the professional decline and was six years away from the end of her life when she personally brought in the nascent upstart for several numbers on the Oct. 6, 1963 episode of her weekly variety show.
This particular mashup hardly counts as culturally ubiquitous in 2025. But Grande and Erivo are far from the first to revive it in the modern era, as the medley continues to have cachet among musical theater actors looking for an impressive way to pair up.
Erivo herself has had some practice at it: She previously did it in tandem with Ben Platt one night during his London concert run in 2024. Scroll down to see video of the Erivo/Platt duet, along with other covers. (There’s no apparent record of Grande having sung it with anyone before; she has sung with Streisand both live and on record, but they missed an opportunity in not attempting the tune together.)
If the doubled-up cover feels somewhat familiar to a somewhat younger generation, it may be because it did get significant exposure through an episode of “Glee” from that show’s second season in 2011, as Lea Michele and Chris Coffer teamed up side by side — with Michele’s costuming obviously designed to resemble Streisand’s from 1963.
Other duets that can be seen or heard in clips below include Rufus Wainwright with Kristin Chenoweth; Billy Porter with Cyndi Lauper; Audra McDonald with Patti LuPone — on repeated occasions over the years! (we know, we know); and, going back to 1964, Garland with her daughter, Liza Minnelli.
In the fall of 1963, Garland was determined to have Streisand on her show after catching her at the the Cocoanut Grove in the summer. Norman Jewison, later to be a famous feature helmer, was the director of the Streisand episode (which also featured Ethel Merman and the Smothers Brothers). Mel Tormé was employed to work on special musical material for the series, and he offered backstory for the duet in his book “The Other Side of the Rainbow; With Judy Garland on the Dawn Patrol.” There, he wrote that Garland summoned him to her dressing room and suggested an inspired idea for the show, playing Streisand’s LP version of “Happy Days Are Here Again” while singing a counter-melody of “Get Happy.”
Wrote Tormé: “The result was electrifying, one of those chance discoveries in which two great songs jell into one extraspecial opus.”
That and the other performances by Streisand mightily impressed CBS executives, regardless of whether the guest was yet a major star at the time. They bumped the episode up ahead of some others that had already been filmed, and it aired just two days after it was recorded, on Oct. 6, 1963.
A half-century or more later, it continued to impress. Profiling Streisand for the New York Times in 2016, the paper’s theater critic, Ben Brantley, wrote: “Each interpreted an upbeat song with a big, trumpeting voice that nonetheless hinted at a small, solitary figure within. Happiness, as hymned in these renditions, would never be won easily. You can find that video on YouTube, and it is impossible to watch it without shivering.”
Talking with Brantley, Streisand said of Garland, “Afterward, she used to visit me and give me advice. She came to my apartment in New York, and she said to me, ‘Don’t let them do to you what they did to me.’ I didn’t know what she meant then. I was just getting started.”
In a 2005 interview with Diane Sawyer, Streisand said that Garland “was great. She was wonderful. Loved her … I was very secure then. I was only 21, I think. I wasn’t afraid of failure or anything. But it was interesting to see someone who was so great and so famous and so gifted … She was drinking Liebfraumilch — you know, a white wine — and her hands were shaking and she was holding onto me. I thought, what was this about? As one grows older, what is this fear? And I understand it now.”
Streisand received her first Emmy nomination for the episode, in the category of Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program.
Few contemporary singers would have the nerve to recreate a moment so very tagged to two of the greatest of the 20th century (or in Streisand’s case, 20th going on 21st), but few enjoy the good will, on top of the chops, that Erivo and Grande have going into the second and final part of the filmic “Wicked” franchise. If it turns out to be happy days for them at the Oscars, their ability to nail a tricky duet classic might have contributed just a little, if clips of the performance become as widely circulated as expected.
Meanwhile, let’s hear it for the audience that saw the taping at the Dolby Theatre Sept. 24 and somehow managed to keep the climax under wraps even on social media until now. EIther that, or they were too young to recognize its significance… Nah, let’s go with discretion.
Here are a few of the other versions rendered from over the years, including another of the many, many times LuPone and McDonald did it over a period of at least a decade and a half, long before the former called the latter “not a friend” earlier this year. Perhaps this revival of the medley will inspire them to hold space for one another yet again.

NY Digital Editor
Japanese content trade group CODA — whose members include award-winning animation house Studio Ghibli — issued a letter to OpenAI demanding the AI company stop using their content to train its Sora 2 AI video generation platform. CODA, the Content Overseas Distribution Association, also implied that OpenAI’s opt-out system for copyright holders runs afoul of Japan’s copyright-infringement laws.
The mission of CODA is “to promote the overseas development of Japanese content and take anti-piracy measures,” the organization says. CODA, at the request of its member companies, submitted a written request to OpenAI last week regarding Sora 2, which launched in September and is able to generate high-quality, realistic-looking video.

“CODA has confirmed that a large portion of content produced by Sora 2 closely resembles Japanese content or images,” the group said in the letter, dated Oct. 27. “CODA has determined that this is the result of using Japanese content as machine learning data. In cases, as with Sora 2, where specific copyrighted works are reproduced or similarly generated as outputs, CODA considers that the act of replication during the machine learning process may constitute copyright infringement.” Popular on Variety

In addition, the CODA letter objected to OpenAI’s opt-out system for Sora 2 for copyright holders — meaning IP owners must alert OpenAI if they do not want their copyrighted work included in the generative AI model. U.S.-based entertainment companies and orgs, including the MPA , have also raised alarms about the opt-out model. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said Sora 2 will give rightsholders “more granular control over generation of characters, similar to the opt-in model for likeness but with additional controls.”
According to to CODA, under Japan’s copyright system, “prior permission is generally required for the use of copyrighted works, and there is no system allowing one to avoid liability for infringement through subsequent objections.”
The Japanese trade group demanded OpenAI stop using member content for machine learning without their permission and requested that OpenAI “responds sincerely to claims and inquiries from CODA member companies regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2’s outputs.”
Representatives for OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this year, after OpenAI released what it called its “most advanced image generator yet” built into ChatGPT, users created a flood of images that mimicked the style of Studio Ghibli. Altman wrote in a tweet about the viral trend : “> be me / > grind for a decade trying to help make superintelligence to cure cancer or whatever / > mostly no one cares for first 7.5 years, then for 2.5 years everyone hates you for everything / > wake up one day to hundreds of messages: ‘look i made you into a twink ghibli style haha.’”
Notably, Hayao Miyazaki, the co-founder of award-winning Studio Ghibli, in the past expressed strong disapproval of AI-generated animation. In a 2016 meeting where he was shown an AI animation demo, Miyazaki said, “I am utterly disgusted. If you really want to make creepy stuff you can go ahead and do it. I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.” He also said, “I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.”
Members of CODA, founded in 2002, produce content that spans anime, movies, TV, music, video games and publishing. Companies that are members of the group include: Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc.-owned Aniplex Inc., NTT DoCoMo Studio & Live, Kadokawa, Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions Co., Square Enix, Studio Ghibli, Tokyo Broadcasting Systems Television, TV Asahi, TV Tokyo, Toei Co., Toho Co., TMS Entertainment, Nippon Television Network, Japan Broadcasting Corp., Bandai and Bandai Namco Filmworks, Fuji Television Network, Universal Music and Yomiuri Telecasting Corp.
The letter from CODA to OpenAI was first reported by gaming news site Automaton.

The show was recorded at the Dolby Theater on Sept. 24 with a packed audience of “Wicked” fans dressed for the occasion.
Plenty of standout moments made the broadcast — including a duet of the Judy Garland-Barbra Streisand classic “Happy Days Are Here Again/ Get Happy,” performed by film stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo — but some of the evening’s most delightful off-camera moments didn’t make the final cut.

Here are a few things you didn’t see on air: Popular on Variety
Before cameras rolled, the audience was enlisted to learn choreography for the opening number, “No One Mourns the Wicked.” Those seated in the orchestra section were given faux tulips and taught the flower choreography from the film — tossing them into the air on cue, timed to Grande’s entrance as Glinda the Good. The group rehearsed for several minutes before dancers joined for a final run-through and filming.
The sequences were filmed out of order and included full musical numbers along with the scene-to-scene transitions. While most numbers required only a single take, a few — including “The Wizard and I” and “Defying Gravity” — were performed twice to secure a clean version, giving the audience an extra encore. Grande and Erivo’s duet of “Happy Days Are Here Again/ Get Happy” also received an extra run-through — not for technical reasons, but simply because the pair wanted to “do it again.”
Along with taping alternate versions of musical performances, the production also recorded multiple intros for the show’s packaged segments. At one point, director Jon M. Chu filmed two separate setups: one introducing a segment of unseen audition tapes from actors “who tried out for the film” including Khloe Kardashian, Shaquille O’ Neal and Ludacris, and another teasing a new, exclusive clip. Only the unseen auditions made the broadcast, suggesting the other was ultimately cut.
Throughout the night, Grande, Erivo, and the cast teased exclusive looks at new film clips and musical moments — but the live audience didn’t end up seeing them. At one point, Grande and Erivo introduced the new songs premiering in the film and set up a “first listen,” only for no clip to appear. “We’re sorry, you won’t actually hear them tonight!” Grande apologized. “Isn’t that evil? We said that!” Erivo chimed in, adding, “That was not our fault. We want to give you everything — we love you!” Later, Bowen Yang and Ethan Slater teased a performance of “For Good” pre-recorded at the Gershwin Theatre, where “Wicked” lives on Broadway — only to reveal the audience wouldn’t be seeing it. The room responded with playful groans. “Sorry, guys!” Yang said.
The broadcast version featured a “Wicked” reunion of Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, who first played the characters in the original Broadway production and made a cameo in the first film. Grande and Erivo were also on stage and the four were accompanied by composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz on piano.
During downtime, Bill Sindelar was tasked with emcee duties and kept spirits high. He updated the crowd on the run of show, mingled with audience members — even inviting those in elaborate costumes to the front to show them off — and helped guide the taping of audience reaction shots and B-roll.
The taping stretched over four hours, with breaks between scenes as production reset for the next setup. During those pauses, music kept the crowd energized — from Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club,” which sparked a full-blown sing-along, to “Hot to Go!” which resulted in an emcee-led dance session. Later, when “Thank U, Next” began playing, Grande surprised the crowd by popping back onstage, laughing as she shared a quick moment with the audience.
Marissa Bode, who plays Nessarose, introduced “Defying Gravity” with a speech about authenticity and resilience. “This song is an ode to authenticity and about believing in yourself — no matter what obstacles the world puts in your way,” she said. The broadcast version cut to her intro; however, Bode added: “Whether it be school bullies… or power-hungry dictators…” which prompted a loud, sustained cheer in the room. Though the line was removed for the broadcast, the ovation lasted nearly 30 seconds live.
In a surprising turn of events, Grande picked an audience member to perform opposite with, instead of her usual scene partner Erivo as Elphaba. The lucky audience member happened to be a young 4-year-old boy named Remington. Remington was dressed as Elphaba, complete with a broom prop. Grande placed him down on the bed and danced and sang her way through the song, interacting with him. There were no unexpected surprises there. Grande and her newest co-star performed “Popular” in one take. And yes, she did give him his broom back.
Choreographer Christopher Scott revealed he had stood in for the child during rehearsals. “It was me and Ari, and I’m pretending to be this 4-year-old child. In my mind, I’m thinking, ‘I don’t know what a 4-year-old child is going to do.'” Backstage, Scott was watching the monitors, having mini celebrations every time something worked.
People’s sexiest man alive, Jonathan Bailey, wasn’t available the day the show taped. “They were trying to move mountains to make it happen,” Scott told Variety.
Once the team knew it wasn’t going to happen, the team came up with various ideas to try to represent the number on the show. Scott said, “We wanted to honor Jonathan, and honor the show, and give the fans something fresh and new that was fun for them.”
Enter Bowen Yang as Fiyero. “It opened up this opportunity to see another side of him,” said Scott. And they weren’t done yet — Slater and Bode also got to don Fiyero’s outfit and dance through life.

Once the team knew it wasn’t going to happen, the team came up with various ideas to try to represent the number on the show. Scott said, “We wanted to honor Jonathan, and honor the show, and give the fans something fresh and new that was fun for them.”
Enter Bowen Yang as Fiyero. “It opened up this opportunity to see another side of him,” said Scott. And they weren’t done yet — Slater and Bode also got to don Fiyero’s outfit and dance through life.

NY Digital Editor
Obsidian , launching this week with Imagine Entertainment as a key partner, is an AI-powered studio start-up. But its founders say that’s not the full picture: Their venture, they say, is focused on using technology to empower creatives to make their entertainment and advertising productions more efficient — and ultimately pack an even bigger emotional punch.
The company was incorporated in January 2025 by Wes Walker, a commercial director who hails from Texas, and Louis Gheysens, a Belgian native who is CEO of global creative studio Gang Group. The two have been working together for almost two years to start up the company. “AI gives us a chance to imagine beyond the limits of production,” says Walker. “It’s a way to build new worlds and bring audiences closer to stories that feel vivid and human.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
The co-founders say Obsidian’s approach compresses production cycles from months to weeks while protecting human-led creativity. While both Walker and Gheysens come from the advertising world, they say Obsidian’s approach translates to long-form entertainment productions as well. Popular on Variety
“We always had high-end cinema in mind,” says Walker. The AI-enabled processes Obsidian is developing are well-suited for commercial campaigns, which typically have much shorter turnaround times, while they also apply to feature films, he says.
Obsidian has a creative partnership with Imagine, the film and TV production company co-founded by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. Together, the companies are exploring how Obsidian’s director-driven units of storyboard artists, CG generalists, editors and AI specialists can serve both Hollywood and global brands. Each unit begins with hand-drawn storyboards and “human-centric design,” before then moving through AI-enabled iteration and high-end VFX, according to Obsidian.
The Imagine partnership with Obsidian extends across development, previsualization, and post-production, including for upcoming feature film and documentary projects.
“At Imagine, we are committed to emotionally resonant, human storytelling and we have already seen the ways AI can be a beneficial tool in that mission,” Justin Wilkes, president of Imagine Entertainment, said in a statement. “Obsidian’s artist-led approach is exactly the kind of collaboration we stand behind to amplify human creativity and we’re excited to be working with them.”
To train its AI workflows, Obsidian uses storyboards and custom datasets developed with veteran industry artists including Marc Vena (“Logan,” “Passengers,” “War for the Planet of the Apes”) and Tani Kunitake (“Black Panther,” “The Matrix,” “Fight Club,” “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”). The company’s patent-pending technologies include DigitalForge, a live team-based production system that can bring AI and CGI directly on set to let artists collaborate with directors and brand partners in real time.
“The artist sits at the center of everything we do,” says Walker. “Technology alone doesn’t move people — emotion does. It’s the artist using the tools, not the tools themselves, that makes the image feel real, the spirit tangible, and the connection with the audience unmistakable.” While Obsidian develops its own AI models, Walker says the company is able to work with all commercially released AI tools and VFX platforms,
Gheysens says Hollywood filmmakers and global brands both face the same challenge: to produce more stories on tighter budgets. Obisidian’s DigitalForge model “was designed for exactly that, scaling production efficiently while keeping creative integrity intact,” he says.
In addition to Imagine, Obsidian has worked with Disney’s ESPN to create previsualizations for ad campaigns, which has let the sports programmer conduct A/B testing on creative that’s more than just a script, according to Walker. Obsidian also has collaborated with brands including Louis Vuitton, Longchamp, Crayola, Aramco, Amazon and the NBA on films and marketing campaigns.
Obsidian ( obsidian.studio ) is owned by Walker and Gang Group, which is co-founded by Gheysens, with no outside investors. The company has 27 employees and brings on freelancers as needed on a per-project basis. Its team operates worldwide, including in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Riyadh and Dubai.

Digital News Director
Taylor Momsen was the latest guest on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and reminisced on the painstaking effort it took to quit The CW’s “ Gossip Girl ” during Season 4. Momsen, a child actor who had already appeared in major films such as “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” and “Spy Kids 2” before signing on to “Gossip Girl,” originated the role of Jenny Humphrey on the series. Jenny was one of the more divisive characters. Momsen wanted to quit the show in Season 4 to pursue her dreams of touring with her band, The Pretty Reckless.

“I kind of just Irish-dipped. I just wasn’t on the script the next week,” Momsen said (via E! News ). “They all knew I was making music. They all knew I had a band. I would play them stuff because I was working on the first record while I was on the show. I would come in and play songs… but I don’t think anyone knew how serious I was at that stage.” Popular on Variety
“It was an easy decision for me,” she continued. “To actually get [out of] a contract was not easy… it was a very long battle of me arguing [with] everyone and going, ‘Get me outta this. I can’t do this anymore. This is killing me. I have something else I want to do with my life, and it has nothing to do with this, and I can’t be stuck here anymore.'”
Despite her pleas, Momsen said studio executives at Warner Bros. Television deemed her “ungrateful” for trying to get off a popular television series, adding: “You’re called all the things that come along with, ‘How dare you turn your back on something that’s been so successful for you.'”
“I just went, ‘Fuck you. You don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re not in my shoes, so how dare you judge this?'” Momsen said. “I was very defensive, but it came down to they wouldn’t let me out of the contract. The head of Warner Bros. said, ‘Fuck Taylor Momsen. No fucking way.’”
Fortunately for Momsen, she had “Gossip Girl” showrunners Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz on her side. They agreed to write Jenny out of the show in Season 4, even though Momsen was still contracted for more time. This meant that Momsen could not act in other projects until her “Gossip Girl” contract was up, even if she was no longer being written into scripts. Luckily, Momsen had no intention of acting anyway as she pivoted full-time to her music career.
“I really have to credit them for doing that for me because they did not have to, and they wrote me out of the show so I could go on tour and be in a band,” Momsen said, noting that she has no resentment towards “Gossip Girl” all these years later. She even reprised Jenny in the show’s 2012 series finale.
“As a fan of television and a fan of the shows, I love when you have the full cast together again,” Momsen said. “You want to full-circle that and round it out.”

NY Digital Editor
Motion Picture Association sent a notice to Meta , ordering it to stop using the MPA ‘s PG-13 movie rating to describe Instagram ‘s framework for new teen settings in the app . The trade group called Instagram’s use of the PG-13 moniker “literally false and highly misleading.”
“The MPA has worked for decades to earn the public’s trust in its rating system,” the MPA said in the cease-and-desist letter, sent to Meta on Oct. 28. “Any dissatisfaction with Meta’s automated classification will inevitably cause the public to question the integrity of the MPA’s rating system.” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
The MPA’s letter, a copy of which was obtained by Variety , said “The MPA prefers to resolve this matter amicably without litigation.” Popular on Variety
“Because Meta’s statements are literally false, deceptive, and highly misleading, they constitute false advertising under federal law… and violate various state laws,” the MPA said in the letter. “Additionally, by repeatedly equating its Teen Account settings with the PG-13 rating (often in close proximity to the symbol), Meta’s activities are likely to cause consumers to believe that Meta is approved to use the PG-13 rating or that Meta and the MPA are collaborating in some way,” also in violation of U.S. federal law. Meta’s actions also “impair the distinctiveness of the MPA’s famous PG-13 mark” and thus constitute an illegal “dilution” of the trademark, according to the letter.
The letter was addressed to Meta chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead, sent on behalf of the trade org by Naresh Kilaru, a partner with Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, a law firm specializing in intellectual property matters.
MPA member studios are Netflix, Paramount Pictures, Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, Sony Pictures, Universal Studios, Walt Disney Studios and Warner Bros. Discovery.
On Oct. 14, Instagram announced it was revamping its Teen Accounts to be “guided” by the MPA’s PG-13 movie rating . What that means, according to Instagram, is that users of teen accounts (supervised by a parent) will be restricted to seeing content that contains the level of nudity, sexual expression, profanity, drug use, violence and other adult-oriented themes that they they would expect to see in a PG-13 movie.
In announcing the Teen Accounts, Instagram said, “We decided to more closely align our policies with an independent standard that parents are familiar with, so we reviewed our age-appropriate guidelines against PG-13 movie ratings and updated them accordingly. While of course there are differences between movies and social media, we made these changes so teens’ experiences in the 13+ setting feel closer to the Instagram equivalent of watching a PG-13 movie.”
According to the MPA, such statements imply a “false equivalency” between the MPA’s human-generated ratings and Meta’s AI-based content filtering. “Meta’s attempts to restrict teen content literally cannot be ‘guided by’ or ‘aligned with’ the MPA’s PG-13 movie rating because Meta does not follow [the MPA’s] curated process. Instead, Meta’s content restrictions appear to rely heavily on artificial intelligence or other automated technology measures,” the trade group said in the letter to Meta.
In a response to the MPA’s cease-and-desist letter, Meta countered that it never claimed the Instagram teen accounts were officially “PG-13 rated” or certified by the MPA. “Meta’s statements regarding Teen Accounts being ‘guided by PG-13 ratings’ are factually accurate,” the social-media giant said in the response, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. “The process involved a review and update of Meta’s content moderation protocol against the publicly available PG-13 standards, as reflected in Meta’s communications.”
“We know social media isn’t the same as movies, but we made this change to support parents, and we hope to work with the MPA to continue bringing families this clarity,” a Meta spokesperson told the WSJ.
The MPA had previously objected to Instagram’s usage of the PG-13 label , saying the Meta didn’t contact the Hollywood trade group prior to the announcement. “We welcome efforts to protect kids from content that may not be appropriate for them, but assertions that Instagram’s new tool will be ‘guided by PG-13 movie ratings’ or have any connection to the film industry’s rating system are inaccurate,” MPA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin said in a statement after Instagram’s Teen Accounts announcement.
The MPA (formerly the Motion Picture Association of America) introduced its film-ratings system in November 1968 under then-chairman Jack Valenti. Since then, the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA) has operated the voluntary film-rating system with a Ratings Board comprised of parents who must have a child between the ages of 5 and 15 when they first join. The Ratings Board watches every movie in its entirety and assigns it a rating and descriptor that aligns with the views of the majority of American parents. More than 90% of parents say CARA’s film ratings help them make better viewing choices for their families, according to the MPA.

The documentary takes audiences to 1988 using archival material to tell the story of how a “political battle in the George H.W. Bush administration changed the course of history.”
“This film examines the climate crisis – an issue that transcends politics – but it is politics that is the ultimate filibuster of hope and change,” said Strong. “The climate crisis is not a “con job” and facts and truth do matter. I believe that responsible storytelling has a vital role to play in this historical moment to awaken and inform. I am proud to join the filmmakers of ‘The White House Effect,’ which is essential viewing for anyone who cares about our fate and that of the planet.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“The White House Effect” was produced by Noah Stahl, Josh Penn for the Department of Motion Pictures, and Cohen, Shenk and Justine Nagan for Actual Films. The film is co-production of Actual Films and the Department of Motion Pictures in association with Impact Partners, Far Star Media, Cinereach, Birdstreet Productions, and Two Square Feet.

Mike Farrell, the actor, producer and human rights advocate best known for playing Captain B.J. Hunnicutt on “M*A*S*H*” has joined the award-winning documentary “The Window on Death Row” as an executive producer.
Directed by Linda Freund, “The Window on Death Row” tells the story of Joaquín José Martínez, a Spaniard who was wrongfully convicted of double murder and sentenced to death in the state of Florida. He spent five years in prison and three on death row before he was exonerated with the help of the European Union. The film relays Martínez’s experience in his own words, shining a light on systemic injustices in criminal justice and capital punishment.
Farrell joins the film after thirty-one years as the president of Death Penalty Focus, a non-profit dedicated to the abolition of the death penalty. He was attracted to the documentary for its “unusual, touching and very inspiring” subject, stating of Martínez’s journey, “The possibility of someone rising out of the depths of despair to become not only a thoughtful but a caring, gentle and humane human being is one of the beauties of this film. This film is really a prayer—one those who watch it will profit from.”
“The Window on Death Row” made its world premiere at Flickers’ Rhode Island International Film Festival in August, where it won the Grand Prize Audience Award for Best Documentary. It also won the Best Documentary Award at the La Femme International Film Festival and the Immaculate Heart Community Filmmaker Award at the LA Shorts International Film Festival.
The film will screen in Los Angeles at the New York Film Academy Screening Room on Nov. 18, followed by a Q&A with Farrell and Freund.

By Todd Spangler
NY Digital Editor
It’s Day 7 of the blackout of ESPN , ABC and other Disney networks on YouTube TV — and the patience of the internet TV service’s subscribers is wearing thin.
Disney’s nets went dark on YouTube TV service just before midnight ET on Thursday, Oct. 30 , after Disney and Google were far apart on a deal before the expiration of the previous contract. The main beef is price: Google says Disney is demanding an unprecedented fee increase for the full suite of ESPN channels, local ABC stations and more while Disney says the tech giant has been “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
For YouTube TV subscribers, the irritation has been growing higher every day the blackout goes on, after they have missed a week of programming including last Saturday’s college football on ESPN and “Monday Night Football.” Popular on Variety
According to a new survey, when YouTube TV subscribers were asked what they have done or plan to do in response to the Google-Disney standoff, 24% said they have already canceled or intend to cancel their YouTube TV subscription because the service “no longer delivers the core content they signed up for.” That’s according to a survey of about 1,100 U.S. consumers fielded this week by market research firm Drive Research.
In addition, 30% of YouTube TV subs said they have subscribed or plan to subscribe directly to ESPN Unlimited or Hulu + Live TV to keep access to the sporting events and networks they want to watch. About 22% said they use or (expect to use) someone else’s login for ESPN or Hulu + Live TV — while 15% admitted they have used or may consider an illegal stream.
If the blackout drags on, YouTube TV’s churn is expected to spike dramatically: 82% of survey respondents said they are “likely” to cancel their subscription if the Disney-Google dispute is not resolved soon (although the survey didn’t ask about a specific timeframe). Note, however, that there is a difference between people saying they will cancel a service and those who actually do.
Regarding the survey findings, a YouTube spokesperson told Variety : “We’re not familiar with this firm and can’t speak to their credibility or methodology. What we can say is that while subscriber churn is always regrettable, it’s been manageable and does not align with the findings of this survey.”
Meanwhile, when asked who is to blame, 58% of those surveyed said both Disney and Google are equally at fault, while 37% point the finger at Disney and 5% blame Google. The bottom line is that YouTube TV customers are fed up — they’re tired of being the bargaining chip in a feud between two giant corporations.
YouTube TV is estimated to have more than 10 million subscribers, ranking it as the largest virtual pay-TV provider in the U.S. Next are Disney’s Hulu + Live TV and Fubo, which recently merged, with almost 6 million subscribers in North America.
Most YouTube TV customers (56%) said they signed up to the service primarily to watch live sports, followed by the overall channel lineup (43%) and access to ABC (33%). About 27% said YouTube’s NFL Sunday Ticket also played a role; Sunday Ticket is also available from YouTube without a YouTube TV subscription. Price and features matter too: 51% cited a lower price for YouTube TV than cable or other pay-TV options, while 47% said they value the ability to share the service with household members or use multiple streams and 40% signed up for the picture quality and reliability.
YouTube says YouTube TV customers will receive a one-time $20 credit if Disney networks are unavailable for an “extended” amount of time. (According to a YouTube rep, the company has not shared anything specific in terms of timing for the credit but said subscribers will receive an email once the credit is available.)
Many YouTube TV customers, though, said a $20 credit would not be enough to prevent them from canceling: Only 30% agreed it would, while 44% disagreed and 26% were neutral, according to the survey. That shows that “a one-time credit does not match the emotional and practical loss of ESPN and ABC for most subscribers,” according to Drive Research.
The results are based on an online survey conducted by Drive Research with 1,107 consumers who use streaming and live TV services. The company said the sample size carries a margin of error of approximately +/- 3% at the 95% confidence level.

By Todd Spangler
NY Digital Editor
It’s Day 7 of the blackout of ESPN , ABC and other Disney networks on YouTube TV — and the patience of the internet TV service’s subscribers is wearing thin.
Disney’s nets went dark on YouTube TV service just before midnight ET on Thursday, Oct. 30 , after Disney and Google were far apart on a deal before the expiration of the previous contract. The main beef is price: Google says Disney is demanding an unprecedented fee increase for the full suite of ESPN channels, local ABC stations and more while Disney says the tech giant has been “refusing to pay fair rates for our channels.” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
For YouTube TV subscribers, the irritation has been growing higher every day the blackout goes on, after they have missed a week of programming including last Saturday’s college football on ESPN and “Monday Night Football.” Popular on Variety
According to a new survey, when YouTube TV subscribers were asked what they have done or plan to do in response to the Google-Disney standoff, 24% said they have already canceled or intend to cancel their YouTube TV subscription because the service “no longer delivers the core content they signed up for.” That’s according to a survey of about 1,100 U.S. consumers fielded this week by market research firm Drive Research.
In addition, 30% of YouTube TV subs said they have subscribed or plan to subscribe directly to ESPN Unlimited or Hulu + Live TV to keep access to the sporting events and networks they want to watch. About 22% said they use or (expect to use) someone else’s login for ESPN or Hulu + Live TV — while 15% admitted they have used or may consider an illegal stream.
If the blackout drags on, YouTube TV’s churn is expected to spike dramatically: 82% of survey respondents said they are “likely” to cancel their subscription if the Disney-Google dispute is not resolved soon (although the survey didn’t ask about a specific timeframe). Note, however, that there is a difference between people saying they will cancel a service and those who actually do.
Regarding the survey findings, a YouTube spokesperson told Variety : “We’re not familiar with this firm and can’t speak to their credibility or methodology. What we can say is that while subscriber churn is always regrettable, it’s been manageable and does not align with the findings of this survey.”
Meanwhile, when asked who is to blame, 58% of those surveyed said both Disney and Google are equally at fault, while 37% point the finger at Disney and 5% blame Google. The bottom line is that YouTube TV customers are fed up — they’re tired of being the bargaining chip in a feud between two giant corporations.
YouTube TV is estimated to have more than 10 million subscribers, ranking it as the largest virtual pay-TV provider in the U.S. Next are Disney’s Hulu + Live TV and Fubo, which recently merged, with almost 6 million subscribers in North America.
Most YouTube TV customers (56%) said they signed up to the service primarily to watch live sports, followed by the overall channel lineup (43%) and access to ABC (33%). About 27% said YouTube’s NFL Sunday Ticket also played a role; Sunday Ticket is also available from YouTube without a YouTube TV subscription. Price and features matter too: 51% cited a lower price for YouTube TV than cable or other pay-TV options, while 47% said they value the ability to share the service with household members or use multiple streams and 40% signed up for the picture quality and reliability.
YouTube says YouTube TV customers will receive a one-time $20 credit if Disney networks are unavailable for an “extended” amount of time. (According to a YouTube rep, the company has not shared anything specific in terms of timing for the credit but said subscribers will receive an email once the credit is available.)
Many YouTube TV customers, though, said a $20 credit would not be enough to prevent them from canceling: Only 30% agreed it would, while 44% disagreed and 26% were neutral, according to the survey. That shows that “a one-time credit does not match the emotional and practical loss of ESPN and ABC for most subscribers,” according to Drive Research.
The results are based on an online survey conducted by Drive Research with 1,107 consumers who use streaming and live TV services. The company said the sample size carries a margin of error of approximately +/- 3% at the 95% confidence level.

Pauline Collins , the British actress known for her role in “ Shirley Valentine ,” died on Thursday in London. She was 85.
The BBC reported that Collins died peacefully in a care home surrounded by her family. Collins had Parkinson’s disease for several years.
“Pauline was so many things to so many people, playing a variety of roles in her life. A bright, sparky, witty presence on stage and screen,” said Collins’ family in a statement to the BBC. “Her illustrious career saw her play politicians, mothers and queens. She will always be remembered as the iconic, strong-willed, vivacious and wise Shirley Valentine – a role that she made all her own.

Born in Exmouth, Devon, Collins was educated at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Before she started her career as an actress, she began her professional work as a teacher. In 1962, Collins made her West End debut in “Passion Flower Hotel” and got her first role in “Secrets of a Windmill Girl” in 1966.
In 1967, Collins appeared as Samantha Briggs in Doctor Who’s “The Faceless Ones,” starring alongside Patrick Troughton and Frazer Hines. Later in the ’70s, Collins played the role of Sarah in “Upstairs, Downstairs,” where she appeared regularly throughout the series.
In 1988, Collins starred in the one-woman play titled “Shirley Valentine,” then reprised her role on Broadway and in the film version in 1989. Playing a bored housewife who comes alive when she meets a man in Greece, Collins was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.
After her role in “Shirley Valentine,” Collins starred in ITV’s “Forever Green,” created and written by Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham.
In 2001, Collins was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2001 Birthday Honours for services to drama.
Collins is survived by her husband John Alderton, her three children, Nicholas, Kate, and Richard, and her family.

The first five minutes of the final season of “ Stranger Things ” have been revealed.
After the Season 5 premiere in Los Angeles on Thursday night, Netflix surprise dropped the clip on YouTube, which takes viewers all the way back to the beginning of the series after the 1983 disappearance of Will Byers (Noah Schnapp).
Titled “The Crawl,” the first episode opens on a young Will in the Upside Down, trying to calm himself down by softly singing the Clash’s “Should I Stay or Should I Go.” Suddenly, a Demogorgon attacks, chasing Will up a tree and leading to a gnarly fall. Knocked unconscious, Will is then dragged by the Demogorgon to the lair of Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower). Wrapping Will up in his vines with one over his mouth, Vecna says creepily: “At long last, we can begin. You and I, we are going to do such beautiful things together.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'

“The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna,” the synopsis for Season 5 reads. “But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.”

Artisans Editor
Guillermo del Toro was a young child growing up in Mexico when he first saw James Whale’s 1931 film adaptation of “ Frankenstein .”
The film was an epiphany for the young boy, who spent every Sunday going to church at the crack of dawn. He understood his Catholic faith better through the film than the sermons he heard.
Almost six decades later, del Toro has fulfilled his desire to reimagine “Frankenstein” and Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel by rewriting the narrative of who the monster really is. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
His film stars Oscar Isaac as Victor, a crazed scientist who sets out to conquer death and brings to life a Creature, played by Jacob Elordi. In this version, del Toro uses his imagination to tell a story from both the perspective of the creator and the Creature.
As part of the film’s launch, “ Frankenstein: Crafting a Tale Eternal ,” a fully immersive and free exhibit, is open through Nov. 9 at the Old Selfridges Hotel in London.
“Frankenstein: Crafting a Tale Eternal” showcases rare editions of Mary Shelley’s classic book, as well as costumes by Kate Hawley, production design pieces by Tamara Deverell and prosthetics by Mike Hill.
In the video above, del Toro gives Variety ’s senior artisans editor Jazz Tangcay an exclusive tour of the exhibit, highlighting many of the key pieces and the work of his artisans. Read on for more.
There are three main revisions of the book; on display are the 1818 edition and the 1835 illustrated version. “The one I read when I was a kid was the first published in 1818,” del Toro says. “It’s sort of an unruly book. It’s a beautifully hungry book. She asked all the questions — philosophical, economic and social — that she felt troubled by.”
Reflecting on society at the time, del Toro explains that the writers Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley and Lord Bryon were all “punks,” adding: “They were really undomesticated youth, going against their parents’ world and the world of etiquette and properly educated kids.”
In the film, Mia Goth takes on two roles. She first plays young Victor Frankenstein’s mother, who dies in childbirth, and later appears as Elizabeth, who is engaged to Frankenstein’s brother, William. Elizabeth is fascinated by insects and science. “Elizabeth’s wardrobe represents nature. That’s why she connects with the Creature,” del Toro explains. “She represents the Holy and the natural world. So she’s dressed in white, which is purity. It’s also the Creature.”
The white wedding dress has a ribbon bodice and was Hawley’s homage to the “Bride of Frankenstein,” while the bandages are a direct visual connection to the Creature’s costume.
The blue dress was inspired by x-rays, which are patterned into the designs.
Hawley and a team of craftspeople worked across the globe embroidering, aging and tinting the costumes for the film. Del Toro stresses the costumes are “not eye candy. It’s eye protein.”
Issac plays Victor Frankenstein. As a young man, he was raised by his domineering father (Charles Dance), who sits with him and teaches him about the sciences. When Victor loses his mother, he sets out to find a way to conquer death by creating life.
Del Toro explains that the cycle of pain is something Isaac understood when the two met. “We come from Latin families where the shadow of the Father looms very large,” he says. In “Frankenstein,” the shadow starts with Dance and is passed on to Victor. Of Isaac del Toro says: “He knew he needed to do a larger-than-life performance.”
Del Toro wanted to show the Creature as a newly minted human being. Prosthetics artist Mike Hill knew del Toro didn’t want a monster, but a character.
“We follow with the experiments in Victor’s lab that, again, have the language of red and have the brutality of Victor, being an artist whose musical notes happen to be anatomical,” del Toro says.
Color again plays an important role. “Victor and Elizabeth are the only ones that are going to have red because Elizabeth is the mother in a way, and Victor is on a quest for eternal life because his mother died,” he adds. “All these things come into play, with the color and art direction.”
As Victor builds his lab and builds the Creature, there are various stages of it coming together. Seamless stitching and different coloration on the Creature’s body reflects how Victor has pieced it together via dead soldiers and parts found on the battlefield.
“By the time the creature is revealed, [the audience] already saw the things that make him unique,” del Toro says. “He looks like a newborn, not like a ICU victim. And that’s important.”
Del Toro turned to his go-to production designer Tamara Deverell to bring the film’s epic scale to life. From building Victor’s lab to the film’s ship, Deverell scouted across Scotland and Toronto.
Visually, del Toro’s use of circle motifs, as seen in “Crimson Peak,” “The Shape of Water” and “Nightmare Alley,” was used to symbolize the circular narrative of “Frankenstein.” The film’s begins at dawn with the captain and ends at dawn behind the Creature. This can also be seen in the windows aboard the ship and in Victor’s lab.
Del Toro points out that “the circle is broken when the Creature takes control of the ship; that’s finally the liberation in the film.”
Another visual of the circular motif is the giant Medusa head, which the Creature notices. It reflects “the mythological scale of the movie; the misunderstood monster that is Medusa. Medusa is used in waterways and water towers and cisterns in the Middle East.” He continues, “We took her and put her here to remind [people] of the scale of the film being epic.”
Del Toro’s film reimagines Shelley’s classic and the monster by humanizing him. Aside from telling the story from both perspectives, the Creature comes to forgive his creator, Victor Frankenstein.
In the film, Victor emotionally abuses the Creature. It’s a pattern of generational trauma — Victor suffered at the hands of his father, and now, he’s inflicting the same on his creation. Which leads to the question: Who is the real monster? It’s the human, the creator who vilified his very creation and even framed him for Elizabeth’s death.
As Victor lies dying and the Creature tells his version of the story, the film concludes with a cathartic release for both. The circle is broken, and the two reach a moment of forgiveness. The Creature has accepted his fate; he is immortal. But despite everything, the Creature finds it within him to say to Victor: “I forgive you.”
“The question of the book is, what makes us human and why are we here?” del Toro explains.
Forgiveness and acceptance are things, del Toro says, we are losing every day. “The movie hopes to provoke emotion from a text that is 200 years old because it’s telling us we should know better,” he adds. As for the Creature’s “I forgive you” line, the filmmaker says: “It’s the one we don’t hear often enough.”

TV Business Writer
An interactive ghost-hunting movie filmed at the the famed Malvern Manor using CtrlMovie tech will debut next April, allowing viewers to partake in the paranormal investigation themselves in a gameified viewing experience.
Created by Andrew Zeiderman (“KPopped,” “Kisstory,” “Southern Charm”) and Scott C. Silver (“The Pyramid,” “Wheelman,” “BornStars”), the film is titled “Control Your Fear” and is described as merging “the authenticity of a real paranormal investigation with the dynamic participation of a live interactive game—creating something entirely new: a hybrid of reality, technology, and audience-driven storytelling.” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Production wrapped on “Control Your Fear” this week at Malvern Manor in Iowa, which is among the list of top reportedly haunted locations in the United States. Popular on Variety
Here’s Kino’s synopsis for “Control Your Fear”:
The experience follows three real-life personalities—each chosen for their unique backgrounds and belief systems in the paranormal. Jake Bruce, an online ghost hunter and social-media influencer, brings an investigator’s eye; Bri Luna, founder of The Hoodwitch and a leading modern mystic, offers a deeply spiritual perspective; and Alexandra Deaver, a ghost-hunting enthusiast and direct descendant of a Salem witch-trial victim, connects the past to the present through her lineage. Together, they step into the dark—but only the audience will decide how deep they go.
During production at Malvern Manor, every encounter was captured live using a blend of modern and time-honored ghost-hunting methods—alongside various divination techniques. The result is an unfiltered and often chilling investigation that expands the boundaries of the paranormal genre. While others have explored similar concepts, “Control Your Fear” achieves it with unprecedented authenticity and the added power of real-time audience interactivity. The investigation successfully documented numerous terrifying moments that caused both the cast and crew to question the reality of their beliefs surrounding paranormal activity.
The film was made using Kino Industries ’ proprietary CtrlMovie technology, which will let viewers “access the experience on a range of compatible devices—including major gaming systems, tablets, and mobile phones—each enabling real-time choice and collective decision-making that directly shapes how events unfold.”
The CtrlMovie system allows for both single- and multi-player decision-making that allows for different endings based on participants’ choices.
“This is ghost hunting like you’ve never experienced before,” co-creator Silver said. “It takes the familiar genre and turns the dial all the way up, making the audience an active force inside the investigation. This isn’t a game or a show; it’s a completely new kind of experience that blurs the line between spectator and participant.”
Zeiderman, who also directed the project, added: “For decades, fans have watched investigators probe the unknown. Now, for the first time, they’re not just watching the hunt—they’re inside it. ‘Control Your Fear’ breaks the mold of how paranormal stories are told and invites audiences to face the fear for themselves. Malvern Manor is the first haunted location to be encountered in our series of paranormal experiences.”

Olsen plays a woman who has died and must decide where she’d like to spend eternity — and with whom: either with her first husband (Callum Turner), who died in the Korean War, or her second (Teller), whom she was married to for more than 60 years.

Olsen told me she has been imagining what it will be like when she leaves this Earth for quite some time. Popular on Variety
“I’ve had this kind of plotted out from a very young age,” she said. “When I was in high school, I dreamt of being a very old lady on the coast of England, alone actually. I might have had an animal, and it would be like foggy and wet and kind of cold, and I would go on long walks and I would be in a small town that had like one of each thing you need like one bakery, one coffee shop, one fishmonger, one cheese shop, one like community center, one theater. It was always just me because I like meeting new people and I like being a part of a community, and I always imagined I would die alone.”
Alone? “I don’t know what to do with that, but that was part of my dream,” Olsen said with a laugh.

Teller hopes he’s reunited with late friends and family members he never got to meet. He also wants to keep things simple.
“I guess it would be, like, cul-de-sac eternity, where I had a house and my family had a house” he said, adding, “Maybe somebody has a pool, but you never have to dry off.”

Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who plays an AC (Afterlife Counselor) in the film, would like to be pampered when she departs. “Like luxury resort, men are my servants,” the Oscar winner said.

Which dead men would she like to have at her beck and call? “Cute ones,” she said. “Hmm, I’m trying to think. I would like to hang out with Cary Grant. I wouldn’t make him a servant, but I would make him, like, an escort — a paid escort to hang out and have a good time. He was so dreamy.”
One of Randolph’s fellow ACs is played by John Early. “In some ways, I want a Studio 54 where I could just dance, but I don’t want to be that drunk,” he said. “I would want the dancing of that, but I would want it to take place in the mountains. I would want a little cabin where I could also dance when I wanted to.”
“Eternity” is directed and co-written by David Freyne. “It’s a really fun world to live in for a year or two,” Freyne said. “You get to discuss what’s important to you — love, what makes you happy and your idea of happiness. We spent most of our lunches and evenings discussing what eternity we would choose or what relationship we would go with. It wasn’t deep and philosophical, but we spoke about these things a lot.”
“Eternity” is in theaters Nov. 26.

U.S. in Progress, organized by Poland’s Tauron American Film Festival , has announced its winners. In total, 20 awards with a combined value of $160,000 were presented to projects in post-production.
“Mackenzie,” about a girl who runs away from home to marry her crush, TV idol Mackenzie Astin, was awarded Platige Image post-production services worth up to $10,000. The film is directed by Mylissa Fitzsimmons and produced by Fitzsimmons and Jaffe Zinn.

Suzi Yoonessi’s “Mother Wolf,” produced by MediaPro and Aspire Productions, received color correction services worth up to $10,000 from Black Photon. The film was also awarded $25,000 worth of virtual studio services for its next project from ATMVirtual. Popular on Variety
The film stars Melissa Leo as a grandmother who finally has the opportunity to realize her lifelong dream of visiting Japan – that is, until she suddenly needs to take care of her grandchildren. Money is tight, so she decides to explore the strange phenomenon of OnlyFans that her friends have been talking about.
Yoonessi stated that the project was born from grief and resilience and was inspired by her own immigrant mother, with her children featuring in the film. She stated: “The film transforms hardship into a sharp, humorous and magical tale about survival, love and legacy.’”
Erotic thriller “Night Nurse,” by Georgia Bernstein, portrays a retirement community and the complicated relationship between a con man and his nurse.
“My grandmother frequently received scam calls, but only one lured her to the bank. The caller was supposedly my brother,” Bernstein admitted, explaining that the project “grew out of this scene.” “I became drawn to this liminal space between love and exploitation.”
Produced by Missing Link Productions and Ruby Mannequin Films, the film received an award from Orka for image post up to $10,000, as well as a sound mix up to $6,000 from Soundflower. It was also offered a ticket to Poland by New Europe Film Sales.
Julia Fox stars in Millicent Hailes’s “Perfect,” in which the world is devastated by a contaminated water supply. “It’s about falling for the illusion of something flawless, only to realize it’s far from it.”
Perfect was awarded deliverables from DI Factory worth up to $5,000 and a grant of $20,000 from Wrocław Feature Film Studio to producer Liz Cardenas to use its studio and equipment for a future production. Additionally, the Lower Silesia Film Centre (DCF) invited Cardenas on a location scouting trip in the region. The film is produced by Freenjoy, Steak & Rose, and Ten to the Six Pictures.
In “Pocket Dream,” offered opening title design or VFX (up to $5,000) from XANF and foley recording (up to $5,000) from Aeroplan, Stacy Martin (“Nymphomaniac”) stars as a wealthy woman trapped in an unhappy marriage who meets a struggling waiter named Theo, played by Spike Fearn.
Directed by Sam Guest and Julia Baylis, also behind “Wiggle Room,” it questions “whether the American Dream still exists in our contemporary world,” they said in a joint statement. “As filmmakers wrestling with our own beliefs, we push Theo into a dark world full of greed and amoral ugliness, daring him to keep his innocent views intact.” Anarene Films, Discordia, Tanbark and Simone Films produce.
Talia Lugacy’s “Ruby Road,” produced by Acoustic Pictures and Witchcraft Motion Picture Company, received $10,000 worth of VFX from XANF, and Earworks and Aeroplan were awarded $10,000 each for sound post-production.
The film tells the story of a character played by Frances Fisher, who is joined by Bill Paxton and Lauren Holly, and who is facing terminal illness. A former school bus driver, she embarks on a long journey.
Lugacy described it as “an existential dive into a dying woman’s memory, dreams and the fragments of her American life. As a collaboration between people on all sides of the political spectrum in the U.S., it stands alone as a testament to the power of a collective narrative to break barriers and build common ground.”
Fixafilm and New Europe Film Sales were also impressed by “She Keeps Me Young,” offering $5,000 worth of VFX, as well as sales and promotional consultancy services and script consultation on director Doron Max Hagay’s next project.
The story follows the complications that arise in female friendships when one of the characters decides to pose for a high school photography project. International Pigeon Production and Tiny Giant are producing the film.
Hagay noted the film looks at how “our culture screams at us to be Empowered and Fierce, while our lives are full of adaptation, settling and giving in. It’s also about the everyday neurosis and ordinary cruelty present in certain friendships and relationships.”
“Take Me Home,” produced by Cyprian Films New York and All Caps, was awarded $5,000 worth of color grading services from Fixafilm. The story is inspired by director Liz Sargent’s real life.
“Liz is the middle child of 11 siblings. Her parents are white, they had four biological children and adopted seven – six from Korea and several with disabilities,” explained producer Apoorva Charan while presenting the project in Poland.
“The film explores the question of what happens when the parents age into disability and can no longer care for their children.” Her sister Anna plays a version of herself. “It’s a social realist drama and we explore some of the big questions around health care in American through this intimate family piece.”
Finally, “Unknownia” – a feature-length animated film produced by Electric Chinoland and Mubi – received image post services worth up to $10,000 from DI Factory, as well as sound services worth up to $5,000 from Aeroplan and score recording supervision worth up to $4,000 from Soundflower. It is directed by Dash Shaw, famous for “Cryptozoo.”
“All the artwork is hand-painted and hand-drawn,” said producer Kyle Martin. “On the surface, the plot is about a girl who needs to learn how to transform into a dragon to save her father. But it’s really a coming-of-age story about wealth, greed and the experience of learning that your role models are just ordinary people with flaws of their own. You might need to trust your own moral compass.”
“I’m thrilled that U.S. in Progress and the Tauron American Film Festival have become a part of this amazing group of nine projects selected to meet Polish post-production studios and generous partners and discover the beauty of Wrocław and Warsaw,” said festival director Ula Śniegowska.
“Two road movies, an erotic thriller and a feature animation, a family drama, and a self-discovery movie selected for this year program mark a new wave of U.S. filmmakers, mostly women, that we hope will reach the screens next year with our support.”

Senior TV Editor
Disney and YouTube TV still have no deal in place, three of Disney’s most senior TV executives told staffers in a memo Friday, and the company faces the prospect of another weekend heavy with sports telecasts that won’t be seen by a significant portion of potential viewers.
“We realize this has been a challenging week, with everyone asking the same question as millions of YouTube TV subscribers during the busiest time of the year in sports: When will ESPN and ABC be back on the service?” said the memo, sent by Disney Entertainment Co-Chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro. “We wish we could give you that answer today, but unfortunately, we are headed into another sports-packed weekend without a deal in place.” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Google’s YouTube TV removed Disney’s networks late on October 30, after the two sides could not come to terms on a renewal that would keep ABC, ESPN and other Disney properties on the internet TV service. The main sticking point is price — Disney is asking for rate hikes that Google isn’t willing to agree to. At the same time, Google has been trying to push TV companies to accept new tiers of programming that could result in some subscribers opting to drop receiving certain networks. The result has been a decline in audiences watching some of Disney’s most popular offerings, ranging from ESPN’s “College GameDay” to ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” Popular on Variety
YouTube TV has said that if Disney’s channels remain unavailable for “an extended period of time,” it will offer subscribers a one-time $20 credit. YouTube TV’s base subscription plan costs $82.99 per month.
“Once again, Disney is resorting to their old tactics like leaking documents to the press, negotiating in public through their paid talent and misrepresenting the facts including from the deals they’ve offered and taking credit for our product proposals,: YouTube said in a statement Friday. “Our team stands ready to make a fair agreement in line with their deals with other distributors and we encourage Disney to come to the table and do what’s best for our mutual customers.”
A person familiar with the matter took issue with some of the assertions made by the Disney executives. This person says Disney has sought rates higher than what Charter and DirecTV pay for ABC and other networks. YouTube has sought guarantees that it won’t have to pay more than larger distributors if the size of its subscriber base should surpass those rivals over the course of the new contract, this person says.
Disney is the latest in a series of media companies to square off with Google over YouTube TV in recent months. Others that have fought with the company include Paramount Global (now Paramount Skydance) , Fox Corp. and NBCUniversal . Each of those reached a new deal without a blackout albeit some did so with some frenzied moments as deadlines loomed. YouTube TV dropped Univision and other TelevisaUnivision-owned networks at the end of September after the two sides could not reach a new agreement — and those outlets remain sidelined from the Google service.
The Disney executives said the company has worked to make an appealing offer to YouTube TV. The company “began these negotiations by offering YouTube TV a deal that would cost less overall than the terms of our recently expired license. That’s real savings that YouTube TV could pass along to its customers,” the said in their memo. “We’ve offered innovative, bespoke programming packages—tailored to sports fans, entertainment fans, kids and families—that would provide tremendous flexibility for YouTube TV and greater choice and value for its customers.”
Even so, the company has made little headway. “Despite all this, YouTube TV continues to insist on receiving preferential terms that are below market and has made few concessions,” the three executives said.
Disney has tried to wage battle against YouTube TV in the public arena, offering last week’s “College GameDay” telecast via X and its own mobile app without requiring a subscription, and making public a request for YouTube TV to show ABC News’ telecast on Election Night. Neither appears to have resulted in any thawing out of positioning on either side.

“Elsewhere at Night” is, according to a statement, a “poetic and contemplative portrait of six characters caught between presence and absence.” The film “explores the space between belonging and departure, where doubt, renewal, and connection intertwine.”
The synopsis reads: “From countryside stillness to urban insomnia, strangers’ lives intersect, torn between staying and leaving. Bound by dreams and silent longings, they search for a new beginning.”

By Cynthia Littleton
Business Editor
The National Women’s Soccer League has assembled an Avengers-like group of star investors in NWSL teams into an advisory board designed to drive new business opportunities and expand the overall reach of the U.S. league.
The effort has been spearheaded by Jessica Berman, NWSL commissioner, who has been instrumental in expanding the organization’s footprint across the U.S. with 16 clubs stretching from San Diego to Boston. The panel members and their team affiliations include: Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Chris Paul (Angel City FC) Julie Foudy (Angel City FC) Brandi Chastain (Bay FC) Sabrina Ionescu (Bay FC) Elizabeth Banks (Boston Legacy FC) Aly Raisman (Boston Legacy FC) Jordan Angeli (Denver Summit FC) Brittany Mahomes (Kansas City Current) Sue Bird (Gotham FC) Eli Manning (Gotham FC) Lauren Holiday (North Carolina Courage) Grant Hill (Orlando Pride) Tamia Hill (Orlando Pride) Joey Harrington (Portland Thorns FC) Bryce Young (Portland Thorns FC) Ken Griffey Jr. (Seattle Reign FC) Alex Morgan (San Diego Wave FC) Lindsey Vonn (Utah Royals FC) Dominique Dawes (Washington Spirit) Magic Johnson (Washington Spirit) Popular on Variety
“When we looked across our Clubs’ investor base, we realized how fortunate we are to have such an extraordinary group of cultural icons, athletes, and leaders who believe – and have invested – in the power and potential of this league,” said Berman. “Their experience and influence will be instrumental as we continue building not just a league, but a movement — one that redefines entertainment and what’s possible in sports.”
The league was founded in 2012 and kicked off its first season of games in 2013. Its season now runs March through November. Women’s soccer has been lifted by the wave of investment, attendance and TV viewership gains that women’s sports has enjoyed in recent years in the U.S. and other countries. Berman’s hope is that the combined firepower of key NWSL investors will spur business development for the league, among other benefits.
The plan is to convene twice a year with team owners, staff and players to share information and address common problems. The league said it would work with Boardroom, the media and events firm headed by the NBA’s Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman, to assemble the inaugural summit in the spring of next year.
The NWSL is banking on the star power and cultural clout of its board members to open doors and bulldoze barriers to women’s sports in general.
“Women’s sports are rewriting the rules of what’s possible — and the NWSL is leading that charge,” said Banks, the multihyphenate who is an investor in Boston Legacy FC. “This league has incredible athletes, incredible stories, and an incredible fan base. I’m proud to help amplify that energy and make sure the next generation sees women’s sports not as the exception, but as the standard.”
The presence of prominent male athletes on the board sends a signal to corporate America and Madison Avenue.
“The NWSL is one of the most exciting leagues in sports today, with growth that rivals anything we’ve seen before,” said Manning, the famed NFL quarterback and an investor in Gotham FC. “I’m honored to be part of this Advisory Board and to help continue building a league that inspires communities, empowers women, and sets the standard for excellence on and off the field.”
Morgan is the Olympic gold medalist and two-time World Cup winner who retired last year after a 15-year professional career. She was a star player for the San Diego Wave FC who acquired a minority stake in the team last year.
“As players, we’ve seen firsthand how much the NWSL has grown and how much potential still lies ahead,” Morgan said. “What makes this Advisory Board so special is that it brings together people who share our belief in what women’s soccer can be — not just as a sport, but as a movement. I’m proud to be part of helping shape the next chapter for the league, the players, and the fans who make it all possible.”

Five filmmakers experimented with AI tooks to take part in a series of short films commissioned by Adobe to show off the capabilities of its Firefly AI platform.
The shorts screened on Oct. 28 at the three-day Adobe Max user convention held at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
The tools enabled by Firefly helped streamline productions that would have otherwise taken months down to weeks or days. But other aspects of the creative process were no different than any film project. It all starts with a strong script, although the mind-blowing material that can be crafted from a range of AI models (even non-Adobe services) can certainly influence the storytelling, the filmmakers said during a panel conversation that followed the screening of six shorts commissioned by Adobe. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
The session, titled “Showtime! Generative A.I. Shorts Screening & Filmmaker Discussion,” moderated by Variety ‘s Cynthia Littleton in partnership with Adobe.
The creatives present on stage were Grail director Ryan Patterson, Native Foreign chief creative officer Nik Kleverov, Promise Studios co-founder and chief creative officer Dave Clark, Promise Studios director and head of genre MetaPuppet and A.I. filmmaker and comedian King Willonius. Respectively, their films were titled “Dreamer,” “Beta Earth,” “My Friend Zeph,” “Kyra” and “Into the BBL Drizzyverse.” Each was commissioned by Adobe to showcase Adobe Firefly ‘s latest A.I. capabilities.
In sum, the filmmakers agreed that they had fun using the tools on a tight deadline to produce 2-5 minute stories and that there is great potential for innovation in content creation with AI. But the human touch of steering the vision and maintaining quality control is paramount for the quality of the final product.
All of the filmmakers expressed positive experiences working with Firefly to bring their visions to life. “We used Adobe Firefly for the imagery,” said Clark, “We were taking AI generated imagery and compositing that with live action on a blue screen and it just really allowed us to iterate. Shoutout to Firefly Boards because if you’re going to use visual effects and compositing, you really have to map out and plan out your shots and make sure they’re in sequential order or else the whole show could fall apart.”
Many of the creatives shared Clark’s enthusiasm for the Firefly Boards feature, where images can be uploaded, edited, or generated with AI to help create shots and storyboards. “The boards that we use made it very enjoyable to work with my editor,” reflected Willonius, “I like creative challenges, so anytime I do a project, I want to try to push myself. I felt, this whole experience, I did that and we were able to make something super dope.”
The core value of Boards is its variety, as it provides filmmakers an extensive pallet of tools to pick from and play with. “A lot of people ask what is the best tool for AI filmmaking,” said Patterson, “What’s great about Firefly Boards is having options. There’s no answer to that question because every tool has its superpower.”
Kleverov credited Firefly, but was quick to also applaud writer Ryan Walls, a “Modern Family” alum who came up with the story that they were able to generate using the tools. “It wouldn’t have been possible to do for a small studio like ours before AI and before using Firefly,” he admitted, “Brand storytelling is great and I love my brand partnerships, but I want to tell more original stories.”
The panel concurred with Kleverov’s persistent appreciation for his story’s human origins, but also his acknowledgment that AI made bringing that story to life achievable. Many talked about the tools as means for greater efficiency and collaboration, but they also stressed the beauty of discovery. “Even after you storyboard, it can sometimes generate something that you can’t unsee and it can take you in a completely different direction,” said MetaPuppet, “And I think you have to be open to shifting. Storyboards can change, and that happens on every short film that I make with AI.”
The process has led to a fusion between pre-production, production and post-production, what MetaPuppet calls “one big loop. Right at the beginning of the project, you’re already in post, and then towards the end of the project, you’re back in pre.” While this may disrupt conventional workflows, it also allows for a more equitable participation in the different phases of a project.
Finally, panelists concluded by talking about the importance of guardrails that protect creators and their intellectual property. Kleverov used Native Foreign’s AI short film “Critters” as an example, which is now being adapted into a feature. He said, “We were keeping track of the human authorship that went into it at every stage, the hundreds of decisions that were made, and that is what helped us actually get copyright on that AI native IP”
Clark concurred, “When you’re starting to think about distributing your films and creating IP, or if you’re partnering with studios and you’re partnering on IP, all that stuff needs to be heavily guarded. It’s very important to do that.”

The bubbles have settled after UTA ‘s ZCON event and new Gen Z-taught lessons have, hopefully, been learned by old-guard executives looking to team with the next wave of movers and shakers in media.
And plans have already started for ZCON 2026 — and more.
“This doesn’t only have to live at ZCON. This idea that we need to be intergenerationally, intersectionally platforming creative voices and connecting brands to culture can exist everywhere, and ought to exist everywhere,” Ziad Ahmed, head of UTA Next Gen, told Variety as the two-day event, which ran Oct.22-23 at The Preserve in Hollywood, concluded. “And that UTA can really be this supercharged engine to accelerate that transformation in the marketplace is something that we’re really excited about, and why we chose to call UTA home. I think it says so much about UTA as a company that they’ve not only let us, but actively really encouraged us and helped us, continue to build ZCON in the same vision of what it has always been. And so we’re just excited to carry forward that energy.” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
As to how other generations are responding to the event, Ahmed notes “my boss just called me, [UTA NY chief] Mr. Julian Jacobs, and was like, ‘This was everything and more. And I want to never stop doing this.'” “And folks of all generations and titles and backgrounds have given us that encouragement,” he says. “I think that it’s less about, for me, this one moment that’s two days in October and more about, what is this movement? And what is this energy, and how do we scale it? Because I think we all need it right now.” Popular on Variety
JUV Consulting, the company behind ZCON and more Gen Z-centered events and projects, was acquired by UTA’s marketing division a year and a half ago as part of the Hollywood talent agency’s efforts to focus more on the Gen Z audience in its entertainment and marketing partnerships.
This year, ZCON teamed up with brands including Cosmopolitan and Coach, among others, as it hosted sessions and panels exploring how Hollywood is evolving, Gen Z’s relationship with beauty, health and Wellness, digital identity, and cultural and social impact.
Participating talent included Adam Faze, Hannah Broadhurst, Auli’i Cravalho, Chandler Kinney, Josie Totah, Michael Cimino, Ezra Frech, Claire Almond, Austin Maguire, Olandria, Anthony Po, Umar Issa, Cami Téllez, Ramisha Sattar, Nia Sioux, Zaya Perysian, Cheyenne Hunt, Andrew Chang, Ella Emhoff and Josh Colley.
“I think there’s so many different platforms and stages that are trying to accomplish this in a lot of ways, and having similar conversations that we’re having at ZCON,” Olivia Frary, executive at UTA Next Gen, said. “But the feedback that we always get is that this just feels so authentic, and that this is truly a place where everyone is showing up as their true self, and no one is afraid to dance or belt their heart out or make a new friend and say hi to someone, give someone a compliment — hula hoop! We’re asking people to do pretty crazy things when they’re well-seasoned executives and folks with amazing careers who usually are in offices and on emails.”
Ahmed added: “And they really lean in and they do it with us!”
Frary says the organizers behind ZCON looks to “lead by example and create a space that folks feel comfortable and safe doing that in.”
“What we constantly are hearing and what we want to be able to accomplish is to create more spaces that feel that way and give people of all walks of life and all generations more permission to be their true self and have these types of experiences — but also come away feeling the way that people feel when they walk out of ZCON,” she said.

Senior TV Editor
Warner Bros. Discovery has been telling investors it wants to split the company in two — and just produced some evidence that such a deal is necessary.
The owner of CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. studio said it swung to a loss of $148 million in the third quarter, as a box-office boost spurred by films like the latest “Superman” were offset by declines in its traditional TV business, which suffered from comparisons to the year-earlier quarter when the company enjoyed rights to broadcast the 2024 Paris Olympics in Europe. The company has been pushing to separate its studios and streaming operations from its TV networks, and has said it will consider a sale or other transaction.

Warner’s planned divide “remains on track to be completed by mid-2026,” The company said in a letter to shareholders. Even so, Warner “is evaluating a broad range of strategic options, including proceeding with the planned separation, a potential transaction for the entire company, or separate transactions for the Warner Bros. and/or Discovery Global businesses,” and will consider an ” alternative separation structure that would enable a merger transaction involving Warner Bros., while Discovery Global would be spun off to our shareholders.” Popular on Variety
Revenue during the period came to $9.0 billion, a 6% decrease from the year-earlier quarter. Without including the performance of the Europe Olympics, revenue would have been flat, the company said.
The company said it added 2.3 million streaming subscribers around the world, but revenue was from such activity was flat with the year-earlier period. Revenue from movies rose 74%, largely due to the  performance of films like “Superman” and “The Conjuring: Last Rites and Weapons,” as well as some carry over from “F1,” released in the second quarter.
Revenue from traditional TV operations fell 23%, to $3.88 billion, owing to the loss of an event on par with the Paris Olympics playing during the period as well as the strong news cycle tied to the 2024 election.  Distribution revenue fell 8% and advertising revenue fell 21%. million compared to the prior year quarter.

Season 2 of “Percy Jackson & the Olympians,” premiering with two episodes on Dec. 10, has a new trailer.
The trailer opens with Percy (Walker Scobell) narrating about his nightmares, which either “tell me the future or try to kill me.” As he speaks, Grover (Aryan Simhadri) is seen on a beach facing a giant tentacled monster that drags him into the sea — before Percy himself is seen in a forest being attacked by a humanoid monster and then by Luke (Charlie Bushnell), his friend who betrayed him in Season 1 to fight for the titan Kronos.

Next, Percy and Annabeth (Leah Sava Jeffries) reunite and compare notes about their premonitions, with Percy saying he’s been dreaming about Grover and Annabeth saying her dreams have been about Camp Half-Blood. Along with the cyclops Tyson (Daniel Diemer), they take a magic taxi driven by the mystical Gray sisters (Sandra Bernhard, Kristen Schaal and Margaret Cho) back to camp, where Dionysus (Jason Mantzoukas) tells them “the danger that Camp is under is greater than you can possibly imagine,” and they see Luke poison the tree that upholds the camp’s protective barrier.

“For the key to our survival, you must quest to the Sea of Monsters,” says Tantalus (Timothy Simons) as various images are shown of Percy, Annabeth and Clarisse (Dior Goodjohn) in dangerous, stormy waters. “We take care of each other. That’s what real heroes do,” Percy says. Then a mysterious voice presumably belonging to Kronos says “Kill the son of Poseidon” — and Percy is soon shown collapsing on the battlefield from a blow delivered by Charlie. Hermes (Lin-Manuel Miranda), the messenger god who is also Charlie’s father, tells Percy, “You can’t give up on your family.” Then Percy reunites with his own father, Poseidon (Toby Stephens), who tells him not to underestimate himself.
“I’m not gonna let some stupid monsters stand in my way,” Percy says as the trailer closes.

It will show at Tallinn, where it is subject of a Focus.
By John Hopewell
Chief International Correspondent
Over the last 18 months, Catalan filmmakers and productions have taken the festival circuit by storm. For the first time since 1988, at Cannes this year, two Spanish movies secured a main competition berth without one being directed by Pedro Almodóvar: Oliver Laxe’s “Sirât and Carla Simon’s “Romería.” Both are Catalan productions.
“Sirât” won a Cannes Jury Prize, Lucía Aleñar’s “Forastera,” another Catalan title, a Fipresci Prize for Emerging Filmmakers at Toronto this year. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
In 2024, “Robot Dreams,” from Barcelona-based Arcadia Motion Pictures, scored an animated feature Academy Award nomination. Carlos Marqués-Marcet’s “They Will Be Dust,” which opens the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival on Nov.7, won the Platform Prize at Toronto, the Festival’s highest honor. Three weeks later, Albert Serra’s “Afternoons of Solitude” scooped San Sebastian’s Golden Shell, the biggest prize out at the most important festival in the Spanish-speaking world. Liliana Torres’ “Mamifera” nabbed best performance at SXSW. Now Catalonia is the subject of the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival 2025 In Focus tribute. Popular on Variety
The Focus, moreover, will not be a minor affair, taking in 46 titles, spread between 40 completed films and TV series, including 8 modern classics, and 6 projects or works in progress. A delegation of over 40 Catalan industry professionals will travel to Tallinn.
That powerhouse punch may be unusual, but it’s hardly surprising, building on a Catalan industry makeover now years in the making.
Behind Catalonia’s Build
One basic driver, as so often in Europe, remains public sector funding. Building steadily since 2019, in 2024, Catalan government investment in the audiovisual sector, via its departments of culture and linguistic policy – ensuring development, production, distribution, subtitling, dubbing and exhibition in Catalan – stood at €60 million ($69 million), says Edgar Garcia, director of the Catalan government’s culture industry unit ICEC, noting that Catalonia’s current government regards audiovisual as a strategic sector, just as the previous government did.
“Catalonia is not a passing trend, it’s a reality that is consolidating,” says Garcia.
Fulsome finance has backed the closest Spain has enjoyed in recent times to a cinema movement. From broadly Carla Simon’s “Summer 1993,” a Berlin 2017 best first feature award winner, a new generation of filmmakers – notably often women, whether directors or producers – has broken through, often making films which are grounded in a local sense of place but grapple with universal issues, coming in on them from less explored angles.
2025 is no exception. Tallinn’s Catalan Focus takes in “Deaf,” a Berlin Panorama Audience Prize winner produced by Barcelona’s Distinto Films and A Contracorriente Films, which explores maternity from the viewpoint of a deaf mother. Julia de Paz Solvas’ sophomore feature “The Good Daughter,” world premiering in Tallinn main competition, plumbs gender violence from the untutored perspective the daughter of a direct victim.
Other factors are at work. In 2020, ICEC launched a minority co-production fund offering up to $300,000 to Catalan producers positioning them, giving this backing, as Garcia notes, as a partner of trust. “Catalonia’s industry stands out for its openness to international co-production. We are not only close to our own stories but have a mature business eco-system which allows us to look to co-production  [abroad],” says Garcia.
“It’s a highly necessary fund and opens many doors, giving producers the option to enter projects such as ‘The Virgin of the Quarry Lake,’” says David Matamoros at Mr. Miyagi, the Barcelona-based producer of the film, a highlight in Tallinn’s Midnight Shivers.
Pan-regional co-production with other parts of Spain has also flowered. The results have been telling. Nine of the 12 Spanish films shortlisted for next January’s European Film Awards are Catalan productions.
Taking place at Tallinn on Nov. 17, the presentation Catalonia in Focus: A Leading Hub for International Co-Production will explore Catalonia’s openness to international collaboration, including the diversity and quality of filming locations and services.
Led by Joan Ruíz, co-ordinator of energetic promotion board Catalan Films, and Alex Navarro, head of the Creative Europe Desk – Media Catalonia, the session will also drill down on Catalonia’s international business models.
Catalonia Co-Produces: ’The Good Daughter’
“The Good Daughter” is a case in point, a case study on how Catalan films are put together.
Co-production is now a necessity says Sergio Grobas, its producer at Barcelona-based Astra Pictures. “Making a first and second film at €1.5 million ($1.7 million) gives you just a five-week shoot, which is a small base for a film, and public broadcasters pay less, and technicians’ wages have shot up,” says Grobas. “So you look for international support which also enriches a project, and opens up new audiences, since you have the viewpoint of a partner from another country.”
Astra first struck a national co-production deal with Madrid-based “Alcarràs” producer-distributor Avalon, which will release the film in Spanish theaters. “Co-producing with Catalonia has the huge attraction that, going forward, the Catalan co-producer may board a future project as a minority co-producer. Astra and Avalon are now working on multiple other projects. It’s a very natural relationship,” says Gorbas.
Belgium’s Krater Films (“Luka”) boarded nearer to the shoot. Belgian tax breaks are among the easiest to work. “Also, apart from tax breaks, Belgium has a strong tradition in dramas, from Lukas Dhont [“Girl,” “Close”] and beyond. That type of audience is very interesting for this type of film,” says Grobas.
What’s the Immediate Future for Catalan Cinema?
Garcia hopes for the normalization of the Catalan language in films and series. For Catalonia and Spain’s industry and audiences at large, it is “definitely starting to happen,” he says.
Released September 2024, The Mediapro Studio’s “El 47” – a real event based tale starring Eduard Fernández as a bus driver who opened up a new route to an immigrant village in Barcelona’s humble outskirts – grossed €3.9 million ($4.5 million), released nationwide in a Catalan/Castillian Spanish original version.
Dani de la Orden’s “A House on Fire,” a Catalan-language dissection of bourgeois pretence, has scored €3.1 million ($3.6 million) in Spanish theaters.
“There is a market for inspiring social dramas, which touch social themes but deliver an uplifting finale, such as ‘El 47,’” says Matamoros.
Netflix has hiked an interest in non-English language entertainment. One beneficiary may be the Catalan-language itself, also satisfying a yearning for authenticity, which is proving a major lure of both films and series.
A Catalunya Media City is being built around the renovation of the historic Sant Adrià del Besós thermal power plant and two new large soundstages at the Terrassa Audiovisual Park. The aim is to attract not only shoots in Catalonia but for production, post-production and digital and video gaming companies to settle in the City creating Southern Europe’s international audiovisual and digital hub, Garcia adds.
Animation is flowering in Catalonia, garnering awards attention and overseas sales, says Matamoros, who points to its broad gamut from Oscar-nominated friendship tale “Robot Dreams” to winsome 2D adventures (“The Treasure of Barracuda,” “Hannah and the Monsters”), Catalonia’s first stop-motion movie (“Olivia and the Invisible Earthquake”) or social-issue animation for adult audiences (“Mariposas Negras”).
In live action, having triumphed with multi-prized intimate cinema, some directors look set to break out of their comfort zone.
After “Romería,” which concludes her “Summer 1993”- “Alcarrás” trilogy, Carla Simón and producer María Zamora have announced that their next project will be a flamenco musical.
Playing Tallinn’s In Focus: Catalonia, “Frontera,” from “Elisa K.” director Judit Colell, retains the social point of her earlier cinema – “our stories must help us overcome an individualistic and insensitive society, and demonstrate that, together, we can build a more humane and supportive world,” she has told Variety – but in other ways, the World War II thriller is a large step-up in scale, as Colell recognizes.
“I’d love to try new languages, more associated with a masculine register, such as a thriller or an action film,” says Julia de Paz Solvas, director of “The Good Daughter.”
Catalonia stands proud at Tallinn, having established itself as an international brand and consolidated a strong ecosystem, as an example which much of Europe will envy.

NY Digital Editor
Apple saw a healthy 15% bump in its Services revenue for the most recent quarter, the highest growth rate this year, as it continues to represent the tech giant’s fastest business segment.
Apple’s Services business had record revenue of $28.75 billion for the September 2025 quarter, topping Wall Street forecasts for $28.17 billion. The segment includes the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple TV, Apple Music and iCloud. The company doesn’t report segment profit or detail revenue of individual services.

Overall, Apple reported revenue of $102.5 billion, up 8% percent year over year, for its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter ended Sept. 27, 2025. Diluted earnings per share were $1.85, up 13%. That beat analyst consensus estimates of $102.24 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.77. Popular on Variety
Sales of iPhone, its largest product line, were $49.03 billion, up 6% year over year. That was a record for Apple for a September quarter — but short of Wall Street analyst expectations of $50.19 billion. The results included only a few weeks of sales of the latest iPhone 17 models , which began shipping Sept. 19.
Apple CEO Tim Cook, on the earnings call, said the December quarter is shaping up to be the biggest-ever for both total revenue and iPhone sales, citing strong demand for the iPhone 17 family. The company expects total revenue to increase 10%-12% for the year-end 2025 quarter, CFO Kevan Parekh said.
Cook also touted the recent 22 Emmy wins for Apple TV (which has been rebranded to drop the “+” sign ), with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s comedy “The Studio” taking home 13 trophies , “Severance” winning eight and “Slow Horses” garnering one.
In addition, he called out Apple’s five-year deal for Formula 1 broadcast rights in the U.S. , which starts in 2026. The deal, announced earlier this month, is worth about $750 million over the five-year term, Variety reported. “F1 is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing sports in the world,” said Cook.
Regarding Trump’s tariffs, Cook said that Apple hasn’t raised prices on its products to account for those increased costs. The company incurred $1.1 billion in additional costs related to tariffs in the September quarter; it anticipates $1.4 billion in extra tariff costs in the year-end 2025 quarter, according to Parekh.
As he has said in the past, Cook said Apple would “pursue M&A” deals if those could boost the company’s business.

The Witchcraft Motion Picture Company production, which earned strong reviews at Fantastic Fest and Sitges Film Festival, marks another genre project for Blackhurst, the Emmy and Critics Choice-nominated filmmaker behind “Blood For Dust” and Netflix’s “Amanda Knox” documentary. He also co-wrote Universal and Blumhouse’s “Night Swim” with Bryce McGuire.
Blackhurst wrote the screenplay with Brandon Weavil. Ross O’Connor produces alongside Noah Lang and Blackhurst through Witchcraft Motion Picture Company, with Set Point Entertainment, Grim Discoveries, Gentile Entertainment Group, Monarque Entertainment and Mama Bear Studios attached.

“‘Dolly’ is a grotesque, beautiful backwoods nightmare,” said Zimmerman, senior VP of programming and acquisitions. “Rod Blackhurst and team transcend their influences to create a beguiling, terrifying new monster; one to love and definitely fear.”
“‘Dolly’ is both the exact kind of relentless uncompromising genre filmmaking we grew up loving and a testament to what Witchcraft as a studio understands is possible and most important right now; creating original IP and making films that audiences want,” added Blackhurst. “Truly independent, thematically rich, and created with care and craft. ‘Dolly’ is here to stay and we are excited for everyone to see the first chapter in an expansive horrifying universe.”
Witchcraft Motion Picture Company’s slate includes Amblin’s “The White Room,” Carter Smith’s “Swallowed,” Peacock series “John Wayne Gacy: The Devil in Disguise” and Independent Spirit Award nominee “This is Not a War Story.” The company is prepping Blackhurst’s action thriller “Die By Night” while completing post-production on sci-fi film “Into the Sky,” starring Sam Richardson and David Cross, and drama “Ruby Road,” executive produced by Rosario Dawson.

TV Business Writer
Othelia Technologies has launched its AI-native storytelling platform, Othelia, which is meant to help writers, creators, and producers “structure and manage complex narrative worlds — from first draft to multi-title franchise.”
Othelia is described as a non-generative AI platform that instead “amplifies human storytelling capabilities while preserving the integrity, ownership, and authentic voice that make stories powerful.” The company notes that “all creative data housed on Othelia is fully owned and controlled by the user, with no data ever repurposed to train generative models,” but available to the user as “structured, searchable data.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Based in Australia and founded by co-CEO Kate Armstrong-Smith and chief technology officer Joe Couch, Othelia Technologies opened its Los Angeles headquarters over the summer . Ahead of Othelia’s launch, former Bento Box Entertainment CEO Scott Greenberg was named the company’s executive chairman and co-founder, and Alexandra Hooven was set as co-founder and co-CEO. Popular on Variety
According to Othelia Technologies, the new platform is meant to address the “bottleneck” of rewrites in the production process by “making a story’s underlying logic visible and accessible.”
Per Othelia, “The platform centralizes canon, structure, relationships, and change impact in a single source of truth—alleviating roadblocks like compromised structure, plot inconsistencies, and contradictory storylines—so notes are precisely scoped, rework drops, and the writing stays human. Teams can search by creative intent—finding specific emotions, actions, or story beats—and instantly access time-coded results across all materials.”
Othelia launched Tuesday and users can now apply for access to the platform’s beta program.
“This is what I wish I could have had at Bento Box” Greenberg said. “Every department builds off the story. When continuity breaks or a note lands late, that downstream ripple hits schedules, budgets and ultimately creative quality. Othelia keeps the canon visible and interactive, so teams can model changes before work starts and keep production moving.”
See below for Variety ‘s Q&A with Othelia leadership on the launch.
Alexandra Hooven, Othelia co-founder and co-chief executive officer: We’re launching now because of this moment, not in spite of it. The scrutiny is warranted – Hollywood is watching tech companies try to replace creative judgment with pattern recognition, treating the art of storytelling as a prediction problem. That approach fundamentally misunderstands what creators do, and the consequences are real: as AI automates more of the creative process, we’re ceding control of culture and narrative itself. The question of who shapes the stories that define us is becoming a question of who controls the tools.
Othelia is built on the opposite principle – keeping humans in control of narrative. We’re not generating content or making creative decisions. We’re infrastructure that treats stories as structured, relational data instead of static documents. When a major studio is managing a major franchise IP across decades of canon, or when a showrunner is tracking character arcs across a series, they need to see the relationships, the dependencies, the narrative architecture. That’s not an AI problem – it’s a data structure problem that the industry has been solving with disparate word docs, spreadsheets and bibles that don’t connect to one another.
That’s also why we’re not training on anyone’s data. Othelia is a walled garden – your stories, your IP, your data stays in your hands and is owned by you. We’re not building a model that learns from your work.
Our customers aren’t concerned because they understand immediately what we’re building. We’re not in the business of creative replacement – we’re building tools that preserve creative control at the exact moment the industry needs it most. The best creators already think this way. We’re just giving them the infrastructure to work at scale without surrendering ownership or agency.
Kate Armstrong-Smith, co-CEO: For someone with an idea who doesn’t know where to begin, Othelia will help you build out the scaffolding of your story before you even move to script – the relationships between characters, the flow of information, the architecture of your story. For a professional with a first pass draft, it’s about making the implicit structure explicit so you can iterate and build faster. For a writers room developing a series, it’s ensuring everyone is working from the same structural foundation – no more version control chaos or misaligned character arcs across episodes. And for studios managing complex IP assets – decades of canon, cinematic universes – it’s the same structural thinking at a scale where traditional tools break down completely.
What they all have in common is that the core story logic lives in traditional documents, in one individual’s head, or scribbled across whiteboards. Change one element and you’re manually hunting for every downstream ripple effect. With Othelia, those relationships become a queryable structure. You can ask: ‘If I move this revelation, what breaks?’ You can instantly see the scenes or characters where a change in motivation matters, or how information flows across timelines.
That visibility matters even more in production. A late story change cascades across costume, set design, shooting schedules, VFX. When structure is visible from the start, you catch those dependencies before they become budget bloat.

TV Business Writer
Amid sweeping layoffs that began throughout ecommerce giant Amazon Tuesday, the company is making “significant” changes to its video games business.
The move comes on the heels of Amazon launching new game “King of Meat” (pictured above), and just as the company had unveiled its revamped cloud-gaming platform Luna and outlined plans to continue internal development on big-budget AAA titles (including massively multiplayer online games) alongside its new push for party games .

An undisclosed number of cuts have been made in the Amazon Game Studios business, as first reported by Bloomberg’s Jason Schrier and confirmed by Variety , as part of the overall elimination of 14,000 corporate workers at Amazon this week. Popular on Variety
Amazon audio, Twitch and games boss Steve Boom says that while the layoffs are happening in connection with the overall company cuts, these reductions also indicate a larger strategy shift within the games business, which consists of Amazon Game Studios, led by Christoph Hartmann, and Amazon Luna, overseen by Jeff Gattis.
“Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best,” Boom wrote in a memo to staff Tuesday, which was obtained by Variety . “We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.”
Boom added: “We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.”
According to Boom, Amazon is “continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming ‘Tomb Raider’ title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game,” as Amazon’s Montreal game studio is finishing work on its “March of Giants” game, while Studio 5 (the team behind Luna’s new “Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg”) “will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games.”
Last week, Amazon Luna relaunched (the cloud-gaming service first debuted in 2022) with a new lineup of premium third-party games, including “Hogwarts Legacy” and Xbox’s “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle,” and a UI update, as well as a party game collection labeled “GameNight.”
Earlier this month , Boom told Variety that the overhaul of Luna didn’t signal a shift away from Amazon developing its own AAA titles, but that it did indicate plans to focus more on “console-friendly titles, known IPs or known play patterns.”
“If you were to trace the arc of what we’ve released and what we’ve now announced from our games studio, it would actually point in this direction,” Boom said. “So what started out in massively multiplayer games, MMOs, we’ve really widened the aperture, if you will. And so you’ve seen announcements for like things like ‘King of Meat,’ ‘Tomb Raider,’ our upcoming driving game, ‘Lord of the Rings,’ and kind of moving more in that direction of what I would call console-friendly titles, known IPs or known play patterns. The MMOs, those are really PC games. We launched ‘New World’ on consoles about a year ago, and it’s done really, really well, but those games at their core appeal to the hardest core-PC gamers.”
See below for Boom’s Tuesday memo to staff in its entirety.
Dear Games Team,
This morning, we are making a number of changes in our Games business. While you’ve likely seen Beth Galetti’s note earlier this morning regarding the larger changes at Amazon that are taking place today, I wanted to dive a bit deeper with all of you, since the strategic changes we are making in Games go beyond what is happening company-wide.
Over the last several months, we’ve been evaluating our go-forward plans, specifically through the lens of our mission to deliver the very best gaming experiences to customers while leaning into the things that Amazon does best. We believe that this is how we will have an impact with customers that fits the scale of Amazon. Last week’s launch of the all-new Luna is a great example, as it leans into both streaming entertainment and delivering value for Prime members, two tenets that are always top of mind in our group. Luna launched with a great catalog of social party games and AAA blockbusters, and we have a lot more to come from Jeff’s team on that front…it’s still Day 1.
We’ve also taken a critical look at the evolving dynamics of games industry and competitive landscape. While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team.
While these changes are significant, we still have a lot going on in game development. Our Montreal studio recently concluded a successful closed alpha of March of Giants and is working hard to finish the game. Our Studio 5 team just released Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg as the launch title in Luna and will continue their focus on more casual and AI-focused games, optimized for Luna. Finally, we are continuing to work with our external studio partners Crystal Dynamics on an upcoming Tomb Raider title and Maverick Games on an upcoming open world driving game.
Over the course of the day, both Christoph and Jeff will reach out with more details on how these changes will affect you and your teams. Most countries with impacted employees have been notified. Our other global hubs will follow local processes and be notified at a later date.
There is no getting around the fact that days like this are hard, and we will be losing team members whose work and dedication have had an incredible impact on our customers over the years. We don’t make these decisions lightly, and yet they are necessary for us to continue to drive our business forward.
Please reach out directly to your manager or to your HRBP with any specific questions.
Thank you,
Steve

By Ben Croll
Spike Lee , Juliette Binoche, Terry Gilliam and Jacqueline Bisset will be among the honorees at this year’s Torino Film Festival , which runs Nov. 21–29 in the Piedmontese capital.
Marking its 43rd edition, the Northern Italian festival will gather a constellation of screen icons, paying additional tribute to Daniel Brühl, Claude Lelouch, Vincent Lindon, Vanessa Redgrave, Stefania Sandrelli, Sergio Castellitto and Aleksandr Sokurov. The lineup of special guests also includes Jason Biggs, Dominique Sanda, James Franco, Dolph Lundgren, Joanna Kulig and Hanna Schygulla, all presenting works both new and revered.

“We’re looking to foster conversations between generations,” says festival artistic director Giulio Base . “I want Torino to be a place to discover new voices, revisit the masters, and fall in love with cinema all over again — with no distractions, just the shared light of the screen.” Popular on Variety
True to that spirit, Torino will put the big screen front and center, inviting honorees and guests to meet local audiences up close in the city’s theaters — not from the distance of a closed-off red carpet. Each invitee will present a work near and dear, all as part of a selection of 120 films, with nary a single small-screen project in sight.
“We’re probably the only major festival that doesn’t program series,” Base adds, with evident pride. “Not because I don’t love them; it’s just a different language. Every event happens in a theater because we want to preserve the festival’s pure cinematic identity.”
Opening with the A24-produced, David Freyne-directed “ Eternity ” and closing with James Vanderbilt’s “Nuremberg,” starring Russell Crowe and Rami Malek, this year’s festival will showcase 104 features and 16 shorts, including 23 world premieres and 11 international debuts.
“In these dark times, it felt like an act of courage to open with a story that reminds us that joy itself can be a form of resistance,” says Base of the spectral plane rom-com launching this year’s festivities. As for the closer — making its European premiere — Base calls it “one of the strongest ensemble films in years, with every actor delivering a truly Oscar-caliber performance.”
Between those bookends, Torino will present a robust slate of competitive and out-of-competition programing. Competitive sections for features, documentaries, and shorts each comprise 16 titles, while retrospectives, restorations, and regional premieres are grouped into three out-of-competition strands of 24 films.
Narrative features in the running for Torino’s top prize include Julia Kowalski’s “Her Will Be Done,” Annapurna Sriram’s “Fucktoys,” Amy Wang’s “Slanted,” Marianne Métivier’s “Elsewhere at Night,” and Gözde Kural’s “Cinema Jazireh” – a lineup notably rich in female perspectives.
“It’s meaningful that 10 of this year’s 16 competition films are directed by women,” says Base. “This isn’t the result of a quota, but a reflection of a reality finally emerging with strength – a vivid, evolving portrait of cinema seen through a female gaze. Contemporary storytelling is being enriched, expanded, and redefined by women’s voices.”
Out-of-competition programing will feature a mix of established auteurs, rising talent, and actor-turned-directors. Radu Jude (“Dracula”) and Alejandro Amenábar (“The Captive”) will showcase their latest works alongside emerging auteurs such as Alec Griffen Roth (“Billy Knight”) and Jason Biggs (“Untitled Home Invasion Romance”). Meanwhile, “Highest 2 Lowest” maestro Spike Lee will also bring his Cannes-acclaimed joint to Turin audiences — a rare theatrical outing for a film that otherwise went straight to streaming in Europe.
“We need to give our festival a twin soul,” says Base, now in his second year overseeing Torino. “Auteur cinema is at our core — that’s our DNA — but I wanted to add a second face: something more popular, more glamorous, more open to everyone. I want our city itself to come alive with cinema.”

Prime Video has unveiled the trailer for the third season of its hit spy-thriller series “ The Family Man ,” with Manoj Bajpayee ‘s iconic character Srikant Tiwari now finding himself on the run from both new adversaries and his own intelligence unit.
The trailer was unveiled at a fan and media event in Mumbai on Friday, previewing the series created by Raj & DK under their D2R Films banner. Season 3 sees Srikant racing against time to protect himself, his family and the nation from an imminent threat, with the hunter now becoming the hunted. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“For the past four years, fans have hounded me with the question, ‘When is Srikant Tiwari coming?’ And we finally have the answer with a new season that’s not only bigger, bolder, and more exciting but also raises the stakes higher than ever for Srikant, as he finds himself cornered with no respite in sight,” said Bajpayee. “Thanks to Raj and DK’s vision and masterful storytelling, and the continued support of Prime Video, ‘The Family Man’ has become one of the most-loved Indian series.” Popular on Variety
The latest season introduces two formidable new adversaries: Rukma, played by Jaideep Ahlawat (“Paatal Lok”), and Meera, portrayed by Nimrat Kaur (“The Lunchbox”).
“I have always admired Raj and DK for their creative abilities and bringing to life a series like ‘The Family Man,’ which has become one of the most watched and loved Indian series all over the world, and I am thrilled to be a part of the latest season,” said Ahlawat. “Without giving away much about my character, I am certain that everyone will be surprised to see me portraying this role.”
The series is written by Raj, DK and Suman Kumar, featuring dialogues by Sumit Arora. Raj & DK direct alongside Suman Kumar and Tusshar Seyth, who join as directors for Season 3.
Kaur, who described herself as a fan of the series since Season 1, called joining the show “a dream come true.” “Playing Meera was both thrilling and challenging, as I had to match the caliber and performative brilliance of Manoj and Jaideep,” she said. “And the way Raj, DK, and Suman have crafted the story with its rich characters and unpredictable twists, I believe audiences will want to binge the new season in one go.”
The explosive trailer showcases the series’ signature elements including witty dialogues, high-octane action, thrilling chases and the blurred lines between Srikant’s personal and professional life. In Season 3, Srikant must navigate life on the run with his family while being pursued by TASC, his own intelligence unit, in addition to the new threats.
“Season 3 of ‘The Family Man’ turns Srikant’s covert professional and fragile personal life upside down, as he is forced to go on the run with his family while facing an even more alarming threat in Rukma and Meera,” said creators, directors and writers Raj & DK. “Both Jaideep and Nimrat are the perfect choice, as actors and personalities to embody these dynamic and menacing foes, testing not only Srikant’s grit and resolve but also his commitment to his family and his nation. Taking the story several notches higher the new season will grip audiences with its edge-of-the-seat tension and nail-biting moments as they witness their favorite spy navigating uncharted territories and peril.”
Returning cast members include Sharib Hashmi as J.K. Talpade, Priyamani as Suchitra Tiwari, Ashlesha Thakur as Dhriti Tiwari, Vedant Sinha as Atharv Tiwari, Shreya Dhanwanthary as Zoya and Gul Panag as Saloni.
“The Family Man” Season 3 will premiere exclusively on Prime Video on Nov. 21 in India and over 240 countries and territories worldwide.

Guest Contributor
In the main square of the Tuscan town of Lucca, Japanese games designer Hideo Kojima stands on the balcony and receives the kind of fevered welcome reserved for rockstars from the crowd below. Lucca Comics and Games , Europe’s answer to Comic-Con, is the final stop of Kojima Productions’ Death Stranding World Tour 2, promoting the release of “Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,” the long-awaited follow up to the highly successful “Death Stranding.”
Set 11 months on from the previous instalment, the new saga has players control Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) who crosses a post-apocalyptic Australia and connects survivors and colonies to the Chiral network. Kojima said that the game was conceived during the pandemic when he was rethinking the notion of connection. “In the 2000s, the internet became a normal thing, and we could now be connected in real time, anywhere, everywhere, and that connection was supposed to be a strength, but social media went in a different way, because it’s anonymous, so people say whatever they want. I am actually for this technology. However, I wanted to have everyone to experience the analog that we have as well. So ‘Death Stranding’ is actually not just about connection, but it’s about a loose connection. It’s not connection with headshots and shooting each other. We don’t actually do that here.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Art director and character designer, Yoji Shinkawa, was also in Lucca to shed light on his continued collaboration with Kojima. “I’ve been working with Hideo for quite a long time, and any conceptual art that I write, the first step is always a word from Hideo Kojima. There are sometimes hints or a strange wording, but that gives me a direction, because if you try to draw something from scratch, it’s very difficult. So this word from Mr. Kojima always kind of gives me the basic idea, so I kind of chew it over and draw the illustration and some characters and show them to him, and the biggest surprise is that he always tries to pull more things out of that drawing. So I rethink and do the drawing over again. I work with other directors or other projects other than games, but this is very unique with Mr. Kojima.” Popular on Variety
Kojima spoke about the challenges of topping the original game: “In ‘Metal Gear Solid,’ every time I did a sequel, the game design was totally different. This time, it was a more normal sequel. I had to keep the best parts of ‘DS1’ to satisfy the people who loved it. But I also acknowledge that a lot of people didn’t play till the end, because maybe it was too tough for them to walk in the Stone Mountains or traverse a lot. Theme-wise it was totally 180 degrees different. But I also made it more speedy, more comfortable for the players, but also more playable and enjoyable, with more freedom. And as a result, I see that a lot of people have cleared a lot in ‘DS2,’ more than the first one. So I’m kind of happy that I hit the mark with this change in the game design.”
Kojima said that the music was important to the game but although he admitted to loving Joy Division – he’s often photographed sporting an “Unknown Pleasures” t-shirt – it wasn’t appropriate to the game. “In ‘DS2,’ we worked a lot with [French composer and musician] Woodkid. Of course, we worked with Ludvig Forsell as well. With Woodkid, we got quite close, and we exchanged a lot of ideas, and I found out our feelings, our way of thinking was quite close. So we got to know each other very well, and he came to the studio a number of times, and then he started to create something. And we went back and forth with feedback, and it’s almost similar to Yoji’s design of what he explained earlier. He stayed in an office, right next to my office.”
What is his favorite character in the new game? “There was a character called Cliff, played by Mads Mikkelsen, and he was very popular. However, in the story of ‘DS1,’ he died, and I couldn’t bring him back in ‘DS2.’ So I thought about Neil. I’m a big fan of Luca Marinelli and I really wanted to work with him. But my favorite is Fragile, played by Léa Seydoux. You might think it’s Sam, but Sam is the main character. He’s the protagonist, but Fragile is actually one of the hidden main characters in ‘DS2.’ For Léa Seydoux, we brought up the technology level of capturing her so she’s more natural in how she says her lines and how she acts, which is beautiful. I also asked Woodkid to create a song dedicated to Fragile. So every time Fragile comes in the game, you can hear the theme running in the background. Overall, it’s a great character. If you haven’t played the game, you’ll be surprised at how good the acting and how good the character of Fragile is. Make sure you play until the end.”

TV Business Writer
Amazon is set to lay off tens of thousands of its corporate employees this week, marking the company’s biggest staffing reduction since roughly 27,000 staffers were eliminated at the end of 2022.
As first reported by Reuters , the Andy Jassy-led ecommerce giant will cut as many as 30,000 workers — nearly 10% of its corporate workforce — beginning as early as Tuesday. The layoffs come just before Amazon reports its latest quarterly earnings results on Thursday and are, according to Reuters’ sources, part of efforts to “pare expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
As of the end of March, Amazon reported 1.56 million employees, up 3% from a year earlier. According to Reuters, the corporate staff count is approximately 350,000. Popular on Variety
Representatives for Amazon did not immediately respond to Variety ‘s request for comment Monday.
Back in June, Amazon CEO Jassy sent a memo to staff that outlined how generative AI would soon “make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today” but also cut the overall number of jobs at the company.
“As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,” the CEO said. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

Hoogstraten launched the company with filmmaker Jon Irwin in late 2023. The swift growth of the company inside of two years has reaffirmed her belief that there was a market for movies and TV shows with themes that incorporate faith, spirituality, family and love of country without being explicitly branded as faith-based content.

If his directorial debut “Everything” (2004) was billed by Variety as a “forcefully executed, slow-burning thriller….a “no-frills, nine-day production,” his new endeavour is another tour-de-force.
A thought-provoking exploration of truth and deceit, moral boundaries, a nod to acting, through a character-driven WW2 porn satire. All of it wrapped in 21 days, with on-screen production value squeezed to its upmost by seasoned producer Nick O’Hagan (“The Serpent Queen,” “The Good Liar”) and Poppy O’Hagan of Giant Films.

“It takes a lunatic to make a film and I’m quite a good one! I realized how comfortable I am with making movies and how I love it,” Hawkins quips, commenting about his 11-year hiatus since his breakthrough pic “Everything” starring Ray Winstone, that segued from his acclaimed screenwriting debut “The Theory of Flight,” helmed by Paul Greengrass. Popular on Variety
“Yeah, I was for a while disheartened by the film biz that can drag you down if you don’t watch it, as you get a lot more rejection than you’ll get successes,” he tells Variety . “I wanted to do other silly crazy stuff, live in different places. But then I felt it was unfinished business with film.”
After nearly two decades of stalling with the script and another project with Giant Films in the making – “The Most Dangerous Girl in the World” – Hawkins finally cracked it. “I couldn’t make it work the way I felt was right. It just didn’t feel relevant to today’s times, but now it does. I wanted to explore the fine lines that we draw in the sand to define our moral compass. What is right and what is wrong, how those lines get very quickly washed away and re-written, notably during war,” Hawkins explains.
The WWII satire is set in the run-up to the Allied invasion of France, when two British film projects are commissioned at the very highest level. One of them is a Laurence Olivier adaptation of Shakespeare’s “Henry V.” As the logline runs, “this is the story of the other project.”
We follow a group of disparate souls, sent to the remote Orkney Island off the northeastern coast of Scotland. Their mission: to make propaganda porn movies to up the moral of the British boys on the frontline. The group is made up of a seriously damaged former movie star, a celebrated German director, a munitions-machinist-come-aspiring-actress, an Etonian major from the Ministry of Information; an aging hair-and-makeup artist and a young trainee sound recordist.
Another person is on the island, watching. But when it’s time for the camera to roll, nothing goes as anticipated as tension creeps up, as does violence and the pressure of abiding to the contract of making porn.
“Nothing chronicles the history of our moral structures more than film,” argues Hawkins, who cites some of the most iconic steamy scenes in film history: Hedy Lamarr walking naked in the woods in the 1933 “Ecstasy” and Burt Lancaster properly kissing Deborah Kerr on the beach in the 1953 “From Here to Eternity.” “U.S. politicians who were afraid that film would undermine the morality of society of the time, created the Hollywood Hays Code, but then WWII put an end to it.”
“Yet two film taboos remain,” Hawkins continues, “and this is perhaps the epicentre of the movie. “There are two things you cannot act: actually having sex and killing someone. These lines can never be crossed in the real world. They have consequences.” As they have in “Think of England.”
On that point, Hawkins said his pic is also a nod to actors, the psychological, emotional, even physical pressure that comes with their craft, especially when they have to perform “uncomfortable” scenes. “With actors, we sometimes don’t consider what they go through in the act of pretending. There’s a huge emotional turmoil going on that fascinates me,” he admits.
Pushing further his reflection on reality and make belief, Hawkins also plays with the audience and our perception of truth in “Think of England” (plot twists are not disclosed here). “We’re in a world of fake news, authoritarianism creeping up; we’re starting to echo the mid-late 1930s with a threat to democracy. Before war comes propaganda and lies. In that sense, the film resonates with today’s reality. I wanted the film to be a reminder not to accept what we’re hearing,” insists the director.
To make the film, Hawkins relied on an ensemble cast including Jack Bandeira (“Happy Valley,” “Lockwood & Co”), Natalie Quarry (“Call The Midwife“) in the title roles, John McCrea (“Cruella”), Ronni Ancona (“Big Impression”), Ben Bela Böhm (“Angels & Demons”), Ollie Maddigan (“The Olive Boy”) and Oscar Hoppe (“Munich: The Edge of War”).
“Our idea was to cast people that would just walk on set and be in 1943, but not A-list names that would undermine the kind of double identity that everybody has in the film.”
An intimacy coordinator was on set to help the actors feel safe and comfortable with the nudity and choreography of the sex scenes. “You could argue that this film goes back to the invention of intimacy coordination. We see the actress Holly Spurring spending a lot of time discussing with the director how she feels about being naked and having sex. Today, you have the intimacy coordinator filling that role, which is great as it’s an uncomfortable position for any director to have,” Hawkins observes.
Shot in 21 days on a shoestring budget – partly in Shinfield Studios in Reading and on location on Anglesey in North Wales – the pic also benefitted from the expertise of cinematographer Sarah Cunningham (“The Banishing”), production designer Chris Richmond (“The Amazing Mr Blunden”), costume designer Nadia Dunn-Hill (“Wimbledon”) and hair & make-up Designer Alexis Arenas (“Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”).
“We shot in color and black & white on a Mitchell Standard 35mm camera and with shifting aspect ratios to tell the multi-layered narrative,” adds Hawkins who said early pre-production work was crucial to set the visual style and priorities.
Made For Cinema
The O’Hagan father and daughter production duo said building trust with the cast and crew, making them feel “part of something unique” was quintessential.
Nick O’Hagan underlined that his production model for indie filmmaking is built on collaboration and sharing, including financially, with the crew being offered “a small profit share of the box office.”
Backed by private investors, the pic was executive produced by Geoffrey Freeman, Andrew Wood and Lucas Wood-Oliván. Domestic distribution and international sales are yet to be finalised.
“We’re looking for true partners, willing to take part in the film’s journey on screens and guarantee the pic’s long-tail theatrical release,” Nick O’Hagan explains.
As such, ”Think of England” is a blue print for the O’Hagan’s new Made for Cinema initiative, a movement “that supports and advocates for non-dependent filmmakers to get their work released theatrically across an extended window, connecting with audiences through events and stimulating conversations and community around provocative and ambitiously authored cinema,” says a statement, referring to a concept championed by indie production guru Ted Hope.
“It’s about staying free from any constrains. This was the case with ‘Think of England’ and we will apply this vision for other filmmakers,” comments  Nick O’Hagan.

While presenting Benny Safdie with a Hamilton Behind the Camera Award for directing “The Smashing Machine,” Dwayne Johnson shared the thoughtful first reaction that Christopher Nolan had to the biographical sports drama and its unique directing style. Talking about Safdie’s bold decisions to keep the camera out of the ring and present fights from the crowded perspective of the audience, Johnson said, “It paid off the first time Christopher Nolan saw the movie and said to Benny, ‘I mean this in the most respectful and complimentary way, but I feel like I shouldn’t be watching this. I feel like I’m violating their space. And it’s so counterintuitive as a director. I really want to give you credit and flowers for that.'” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
The “Oppenheimer” director previously praised “The Smashing Machine” in an interview with Safdie on the “Director’s Cut” podcast in October. There, he complimentarily called the film “heartbreaking” and Johnson’s portrayal of MMA fighter Mark Kerr “an incredible performance.” He added, “I don’t think you’ll see a better performance this year or most other years.” At the Hamilton Behind the Camera Awards, Johnson assured that Nolan had a strong reaction to Safdie’s direction as well.
Safdie was among 13 honorees at Hamilton’s 14th annual Behind the Camera Awards, presented by Variety . The awards ceremony took place on Nov. 5 at Avalon Hollywood & Bardot in Los Angeles. The other honorees were “Roofman” production designer Inbal Weinberg, “Sinners” property master Douglas Ware, “Is This Thing On?” cinematographer Matthew Libatique, “One Battle After Another” costume designer Colleen Atwood, “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere” editor Pamela Martin, “Frankenstein” hair and makeup artist Mike Hill, “Jay Kelly” composer Nicholas Britell, “Rental Family” screenwriters Hikari and Stephen Blahut and “F1” sound artists Al Nelson, Gary Rizzo and Juan Peralta. Sasheer Zamata hosted the event.
Each honoree was introduced by one of their creative collaborators. Channing Tatum presented the award to Weinberg, where he reflected on how the production designer’s recreation of a Toys R Us from the early 2000s evoked deep nostalgia in its meticulous detail. “She really creates environments that bring grown men to tears,” the actor said. “I know that some of my friends would argue I might not be a grown man, but I can promise you that there were some grisly, bearded men that had like cement bags for hands, that I swear to you got teared up when they walked into this Toys R Us. You got to watch them walk into their childhood dreams and fantasies.”
Guillermo del Toro delivered a similarly humorous and heartfelt introduction to Hill. He waxed nostalgia about the time that he first met the make-up artist at Monsterpalooza, a horror and special effects convention in Burbank. “The people that go there are mostly pale like me,” joked del Toro. “And like me, are mostly feed on Cheetos and very, very well versed on things that nobody cares about. But we care vehemently.” He talked about how Hill’s prosthetic recreation of Boris Karloff’s head from James Whale’s 1931 “Frankenstein” caught his eye and imagination. Del Toro insisted on buying the head, which birthed a collaboration that, as of this year, includes del Toro’s own “Frankenstein” adaptation. “We just finished our Franken-sandwich,” the director laughed. “We were both destined to be.”
Weinberg and Hill, like many of the honorees, expressed deep gratitude for their crews and the other below-the-line workers who bring movies to life. After an introduction from “F1” director Joseph Kosinski, Nelson, Rizzo and Peralta thanked their supervising sound editor, production mixer, composer Hans Zimmer and their Skywalker sound team. “The partnership between Apple and Skywalker Sound truly highlights how a commitment to the highest of standards can bring an exceptional cinematic experience like Formula 1,” said Rizzo. “And to our crew at Skywalker Sound, thank you so much for your meticulous attention to detail and your continued pursuit of sonic excellence.”
Ware similarly acknowledged his prop master team, which has remained consistent over the course of several years and projects leading up to “Sinners.” “I’ve got to thank my team,” he said. “I’ve had the same team since Season 4 of ‘Queen Sugar,’ and then we did ‘Nickel Boys’ and then to roll right into ‘Sinners’ was just the best opportunity possible. I have to thank my crew: Melissa Waltrip, Madison Aucoin, Jasmine Hall, Drew Wahardo.”
Libatique concurred from the perspective of a cinematographer, saying, “Cinematography is such a collaborative endeavor, and this honor really belongs to everyone who helped me on ‘Is This Thing On?'”
Some, such as Britell and Atwood, who were respectively introduced by Barry Jenkins and Teyana Taylor, talked about the unique experiences of their latest projects this year. Britell talked about how, for “Jay Kelly,” director Noah Baumbach invited him to the filming location in Italy to play his developing score while the cameras were rolling. “I’ve never done that before, like physically gone and played on set the score ideas I was working on,” said Britell. “I went to Tuscany, and it was just a miraculous kind of experience, and playing the score ideas inside the movie itself was very, very wonderful.”
Atwood similarly talked about the unique process of dressing Taylor and Leonardo DiCaprio on “One Battle After Another.” “As a designer, I feel like I got to do some really new and interesting work, and I will never, ever be sorry that I did this job. It’s just my favorite movie I’ve ever worked on.”
Hikari and Blahut, introduced by actor Steven Yeun, linked the importance of collaboration to the power of story. “Our film rental family is, at its heart, a story about loneliness and belonging, especially in the age of disconnection,” said Hikari. “It asks what it means to manufacture connection and yet find something deeply human in the act, in the world that feels increasingly divided.” In that same spirit, Martin said of “Deliver Me From Nowhere,” “My greatest hope is that people watch this film and know that they don’t need to suffer alone. We are all in this together.”
Poetically, collaboration and togetherness were motifs throughout the evening, as no behind the camera job is accomplished in isolation. “We’re all mining this stuff together,” said Safdie after accepting the award from Johnson at the end of the night. “A piece of the movie exists with everybody.”

Jason Kelce and Garage Beer have teamed up with the upcoming “ Predator: Badlands ” film for a new short titled “Thermal Buzz.”
Made in collaboration with 20th Century Studios and the latest “Predator” installment — coming to theaters Nov. 7 — “Thermal Buzz” is Kelce’s homage to the original 1987 “Predator” starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the trailer, Kelce and former Philadelphia Eagles player Beau Allen sport head-to-toe camo as they face off against Predators in the jungle and, of course, enjoy some refreshing Garage Beer.

“Thermal Buzz” was directed by Jordan Phoenix and filmed outside of Orlando. In addition to Kelce and Allen, the 11-minute film features pro wrestler Matt Cardona. The full short will debut on Friday, but fans can now check out the trailer as well as the 30-second ad that played during commercial breaks of select NFL games on Sunday via YouTube and Garage Beer’s socials.
“As a ’90s kid, there’s nothing I loved more than a good action movie,” Kelce said in a statement. “In my mind, it’s hard to find a movie more iconic than ‘Predator.’ From the memes to the epic quotes, nothing compares in terms of action-packed entertainment. We’re just pumped that our short film can be part of the moment; I can’t wait to see ‘Predator: Badlands.'”
“Thermal Buzz” is Kelce and Garage Beer’s third short film, following “Brewmite II,” in which he and brother Travis Kelce went head-to-head with MMA superstar Chuck Liddell, and the original “Brewmite.”

By Chris Willman
Senior Music Writer and Chief Music Critic
Kendrick Lamar , whose “Not Like Us” single triumphed in two of the three top categories at the 2025 Grammys , has voters having still further opportunities to reward him this year, with the potent follow-through of both a smash album (“GNX”) and single (“Luther’) poised to offer the hip-hop superstar even more of a sweep in the 2026 awards. Lamar leads the pack of nominees for the 2026 Grammys with nine nods, in nominations rolled out by the Recording Academy Friday.

The morning was also a big one for little monsters, with Lady Gaga ’s fan base cheering on her seven nominations, topping her previous record of six, which she scored back in 2010. Gaga ties for the second-most nominations with producers Jack Antonoff and Cirkut, who also found seven to be their lucky number.
Every year there’s at least one rising artist who gets a substantially bigger bonanza of nominations than anyone had prognosticated, and this year that artist is Leon Thomas. He scored a surprising six nods, which puts him in a tie with Sabrina Carpenter, Bad Bunny and audio enginner and mixer Serban Ghenea. Popular on Variety
The six nominations for Bad Bunny, the impending Super Bowl halftime showman, came as good news for anyone who was worried that Latin music might be shut out of the big categories, as it often has been, and relegated to the Latin Grammys. Bad Bunny was shut out of the top three categories in the past couple of years, but there has been a fresh influx of voters with dual voting rights for both the Grammys and Latin Grammys, so any such overlooking was less likely to happen again. The global superstar is up for all three of the top categories, in fact — album, record and song of the year.
Bad Bunny is not alone in having the possibility for a sweep at the top. He’s one of four artists to be nominated in the top three categories, the others being Lamar, Gaga and Carpenter.
There’s no possibility of anyone making a run through all four all-genre categories, though, because the best new artist category is filled with performers who didn’t get much of a look anywhere else. Leon Thomas is pretty much alone among the eight BNA contenders in getting multiple nominations. Most of the other freshmen put up for new artist have that as their sole nomination, including Alex Warren, who had one of the year’s most ubiquitous hits with “Ordinary” but didn’t have the song itself turn up anywhere in the noms.
Fans of the “Kpop Demon Hunters” franchise were eager to see whether Grammy voters would celebrate the inescapable “Golden” with multiple nominations, despite a perception that Academy members might turn up their noses at voting for avatars. The news was mostly positive on that front: “Golden” landed four nominations — nearly all that were possible — including a coveted nod for song of the year, though “Golden” didn’t make it into the record of the year sweepstakes.
Some of 2025’s biggest hits are missing from the Grammys, either through the timing of the calendar or by self-deportation. The year’s second-biggest album is Morgan Wallen’s “I’m the Problem,” but his camp announced earlier in the season that he would not be submitting for the Grammys going forward. The biggest blockbuster of the year, Taylor Swift’s “The Life of a Showgirl,” came out past the end of the eligibility period, leaving her with nothing to contend with this cycle.
But even without Swift making a return run at Grammy glory this time around, there is some instant déjà vu to be found in the top categories. Carpenter made a quick turnaround with her second album in just over a year, “Man’s Best Friend,” and once again she is nominated for record, song and album of the year. Roan and Eilish didn’t deliver new albums, but are back with singles in contention. Lamar is the one who stands the greatest chance of having an instant replay, with both his “GNX” album and “Luther” single among the front-runners in their respective categories, after he won five awards last year for “Not Like Us” — including record and song of the year — without having an album in play.
Commercially, it’s been a down year for hip-hop, but that didn’t dampen the enthusiasm of Grammy voters, who gave the genre greater representation than some had predicted going in. Beyond Lamar’s major showing, Doechii, Clipse and Tyler, the Creator all landed a solid five nominations each. They were tied at that level with the rock band Turnstile, producers Andrew Watt and Sounwave, and Lamar’s “Luther” duet partner, SZA.
If hip-hop was surprisingly well-represented, country was very much underrepresented, with nary a nomination in any of the four all-genre categories. Wallen bowing out of contention might have made that a partial fait accompli, yet Megan Moroney, Ella Langley and Zach Top — all of whom have a major look going into this month’s CMA Awards — were all considered major contenders for the best new artist category. Nashville’s lockout from the major categories year after year (aside from an outlier like Beyonce’s one-time genre dip) is bound to stir discussion going forward.
The Grammys will return to CBS and Paramount+ on Feb. 1 with a live broadcast and stream starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 PT.

Kendrick Lamar , whose “Not Like Us” single triumphed in two of the three top categories at the 2025 Grammys , has voters having still further opportunities to reward him this year, with the potent follow-through of both a smash album (“GNX”) and single (“Luther’) poised to offer the hip-hop superstar even more of a sweep in the 2026 awards. Lamar leads the pack of nominees for the 2026 Grammys with nine nods, in nominations rolled out by the Recording Academy Friday.

The morning was also a big one for little monsters, with Lady Gaga ’s fan base cheering on her seven nominations, topping her previous record of six, which she scored back in 2010. Gaga ties for the second-most nominations with producers Jack Antonoff and Cirkut, who also found seven to be their lucky number.
Every year there’s at least one rising artist who gets a substantially bigger bonanza of nominations than anyone had prognosticated, and this year that artist is Leon Thomas. He scored a surprising six nods, which puts him in a tie with Sabrina Carpenter, Bad Bunny and audio enginner and mixer Serban Ghenea. Popular on Variety
The six nominations for Bad Bunny, the impending Super Bowl halftime showman, came as good news for anyone who was worried that Latin music might be shut out of the big categories, as it often has been, and relegated to the Latin Grammys. Bad Bunny was shut out of the top three categories in the past couple of years, but there has been a fresh influx of voters with dual voting rights for both the Grammys and Latin Grammys, so any such overlooking was less likely to happen again. The global superstar is up for all three of the top categories, in fact — album, record and song of the year.
Bad Bunny is not alone in having the possibility for a sweep at the top. He’s one of four artists to be nominated in the top three categories, the others being Lamar, Gaga and Carpenter.
There’s no possibility of anyone making a run through all four all-genre categories, though, because the best new artist category is filled with performers who didn’t get much of a look anywhere else. Leon Thomas is pretty much alone among the eight BNA contenders in getting multiple nominations. Most of the other freshmen put up for new artist have that as their sole nomination, including Alex Warren, who had one of the year’s most ubiquitous hits with “Ordinary” but didn’t have the song itself turn up anywhere in the noms.
Fans of the “Kpop Demon Hunters” franchise were eager to see whether Grammy voters would celebrate the inescapable “Golden” with multiple nominations, despite a perception that Academy members might turn up their noses at voting for avatars. The news was mostly positive on that front: “Golden” landed four nominations — nearly all that were possible — including a coveted nod for song of the year, though “Golden” didn’t make it into the record of the year sweepstakes.
Some of 2025’s biggest hits are missing from the Grammys, either through the timing of the calendar or by self-deportation. The year’s second-biggest album is Morgan Wallen’s “I’m the Problem,” but his camp announced earlier in the season that he would not be submitting for the Grammys going forward. The biggest blockbuster of the year, Taylor Swift’s “The Life of a Showgirl,” came out past the end of the eligibility period, leaving her with nothing to contend with this cycle.
But even without Swift making a return run at Grammy glory this time around, there is some instant déjà vu to be found in the top categories. Carpenter made a quick turnaround with her second album in just over a year, “Man’s Best Friend,” and once again she is nominated for record, song and album of the year. Roan and Eilish didn’t deliver new albums, but are back with singles in contention. Lamar is the one who stands the greatest chance of having an instant replay, with both his “GNX” album and “Luther” single among the front-runners in their respective categories, after he won five awards last year for “Not Like Us” — including record and song of the year — without having an album in play.
Commercially, it’s been a down year for hip-hop, but that didn’t dampen the enthusiasm of Grammy voters, who gave the genre greater representation than some had predicted going in. Beyond Lamar’s major showing, Doechii, Clipse and Tyler, the Creator all landed a solid five nominations each. They were tied at that level with the rock band Turnstile, producers Andrew Watt and Sounwave, and Lamar’s “Luther” duet partner, SZA.
If hip-hop was surprisingly well-represented, country was very much underrepresented, with nary a nomination in any of the four all-genre categories. Wallen bowing out of contention might have made that a partial fait accompli, yet Megan Moroney, Ella Langley and Zach Top — all of whom have a major look going into this month’s CMA Awards — were all considered major contenders for the best new artist category. Nashville’s lockout from the major categories year after year (aside from an outlier like Beyonce’s one-time genre dip) is bound to stir discussion going forward.
The Grammys will return to CBS and Paramount+ on Feb. 1 with a live broadcast and stream starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 PT.

NY Digital Editor
AI is “the next frontier” for YouTube , according to CEO Neal Mohan — and it might result in the video platform’s shrinking its employee headcount.
Mohan, in a memo Wednesday to YouTube staffers, announced a major reorg of its product team into three groups : Subscriptions Products (headed by Christian Oestlien), Viewer Products (led by Johanna Voolich, formerly YouTube’s chief product officer), and Creator & Community Products (with a lead yet to be hired).

According to Mohan, the moves are related to positioning YouTube for an AI-centric future. “Looking to the future, the next frontier for YouTube is AI, which has the potential to transform every part of the platform,” Mohan said in an internal memo, as first reported by Alex Heath’s Sources AI newsletter . “We need to set ourselves up to make the most of this opportunity.” Popular on Variety
As part of the shift to AI, YouTube is introducing a “voluntary exit program” for employees, per Mohan’s memo.
A YouTube rep, asked for more info, confirmed that YouTube is offering a voluntary exit program with severance for U.S.-based employees who may want to leave the company. However, currently, there are no role eliminations or layoffs happening as part of these changes, the spokesperson said.
Other big tech companies are already cutting jobs in anticipation of massive changes introduced by AI. On Tuesday, Amazon said it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs , representing about 4% of the total corporate workforce, citing rapid developments in AI; more cuts are expected by the ecommerce giant in 2026.
Mohan’s AI-driven reorg memo came prior to parent company Alphabet reporting Q3 earnings . YouTube ad revenue for the period was $10.26 billion, a year-over-year increase of 15%, beating Wall Street analyst forecasts.

NY Digital Editor
Roku , the top independent streaming device and content platform company, delivered third-quarter 2025 financial results that exceeded analyst expectations — and marked the company’s first quarter with positive operating income since 2021.
For Q3, Roku posted revenue of $1.21 billion, up 14%, and net income of $24.8 million (versus a net loss of $35.8 million in the year-earlier period). That translated to earnings per diluted share of 16 cents. On average, Wall Street analysts expected revenue of $1.1 billion and adjusted earnings of 9 cents per share, per financial data provider LSEG. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Helping fuel the growth was the continued uptick in usage: Total streaming hours on Roku for Q3 were 36.5 billion, up 12% year over year. For the full year 2025, Roku raised its outlook for Platform revenue to $4.11 billion (versus $4.075 billion previously) and adjusted EBITDA to $395 million (up from $375 million). Popular on Variety
Investors, however, were evidently hoping for a bigger beat and stronger forecast by Roku, as the company’s shares were down more than 6% in after-hours trading.
Roku’s Platform revenue (which includes ad sales, content sales and subscription-revenue sharing) was $1.065 billion for the quarter, up 17%, while Devices revenue declined 5% to $146 million. Platform segment operating margin was 51.7% (versus 54.2% in the year-ago period) and Devices margin was -15.7%. Total operating expenses were flat at $515.4 million.
All told, Roku eked out an operating profit of $9.5 million for the quarter. Gross profit was $525 million, up 9%.
“Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver double-digit Platform revenue growth while increasing operating margins in 2026 and beyond,” Roku CEO Anthony Wood and COO and CFO Dan Jedda wrote in the quarterly shareholder letter.
The company said video advertising on the Roku platform grew faster year over year than the broader U.S. streaming and digital ad markets. “By expanding integrations with third‑party demand‑side platforms (DSPs)” — such as through its recent pact with Amazon — we are increasing ad demand and meeting enterprise and other clients where they choose to transact,” the execs said.
For Q4, Roku expects total net revenue of approximately $1.35 billion, which would represent 12% growth. Within that, Platform revenue is projected to grow 15% year-over-year with an estimated gross margin of approximately 52%. Excluding political advertising and Roku’s acquisition of Frndly TV, the Q4 Platform revenue growth rate is expected to “step up slightly” from Q3. Roku projects Q4 gross profit of approximately $575 million and adjusted EBITDA of roughly $145 million.
During the quarter, Roku launched Howdy, a $2.99-per-month subscription video service with no ads that includes nearly 10,000 hours of TV shows and movies from Warner Bros., Lionsgate and other partners. It’s aimed at tucking in as a lower-cost alternative to subscription VOD services like Netflix or HBO Max.
“We see a significant untapped opportunity for a low-cost, ad-free streaming service, and we are leveraging the power of our platform to drive cost-efficient sign-ups and engagement, similar to our success building The Roku Channel,” the execs wrote in the Q3 letter.
The company said the Roku Channel remained the No. 2 app on our platform by engagement in the U.S. (after YouTube). The Roku Channel expanded its lineup with new content from A&E, including a channel featuring “The First 48,” which was “one of our most successful new channel launches,” according to the company. The Roku Channel also launched channels for “Shark Tank” and “NYPD Blue,” and added “Law & Order,” which was the first FAST channel dedicated to a series in the Dick Wolf universe.
Among Roku originals, the company said “Solo Traveling With Tracee Ellis Ross,” which premiered in August, became its most‑watched unscripted original (and the show recently received a Critic’s Choice nomination and has been renewed for a second season).
Last month, Roku announced the hiring of Lisa Holme as Roku Media’s head of content, overseeing the company’s slate of content businesses globally, including original programming, content acquisitions and partnerships, sports, branded content, and “This Old House” content and studios. Holme, , a veteran of Warner Bros. Discovery and Hulu, took over the role after David Eilenberg, Roku Media’s previous head of content, exited in June to rejoin ITV America.

International Correspondent
For Milan-based producer Massimo Fabbro, the upcoming U.S. release of “ Trifole ” — which he calls “this tiny film from a tiny corner of Italy” — marks a feat on a par with scoring the mythically rare white truffle at the core of the ultra-indie drama.
On Nov. 14, Cohen Media Group will launch the English- and Italian-language film at the Quad Cinema in New York and in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities, totalling roughly 150 screens. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“Trifole,” which is the sophomore feature of Gabriele Fabbro — who is the producer’s son — was shot in Italy’s Piedmont region on a shoestring budget of €1.4 million ($1.6 million). The project stems from the director’s gastronomic passion for white truffle and its connection with terroir and tradition. Popular on Variety
The storyline — based on years of research around the city of Alba, in the heart of northwestern Piedmont, where the rare white truffle grows — revolves around an elderly truffle hunter named Igor played by Italian stage and screen legend Umberto Orsini (“The Damned”) who is losing his mental grip. His granddaughter Dalia (newcomer Ydalie Turk) arrives from London tasked with caring for Igor. She becomes drawn into his passion for truffle hunting, which then becomes a necessity after Dalia realizes Igor is about to lose his home due to an “accounting oversight,” as the synopsis puts it. Dalia embarks on a quest to find a legendary truffle that could save the situation guided by Igor’s field notes  and his faithful dog Birba, played by a real truffle-hunting pooch. The “Trifole” cast is rounded out by Margherita Buy — known internationally for frequent roles in Nanni Moretti movies, most recently in “A Brighter Tomorrow” — who plays Dalia’s mother Marta.
Financing “Trifole” was what Massimo Fabbro calls a “creative process” in which “we worked hard to attract private investors, most of whom were from the region itself,” alongside local institutions from Alba and the Piedmont Film Commission. “It felt like the territory wanted this story told,” he said.
Principal photography ran for four weeks in November and December 2023. Despite a limited budget, Fabbro and his partners hired a full symphonic orchestra to record the “Trifole” score, which comprises classical works by Ottorino Respighi, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Gioacchino Rossini, among others.
Besides Fabbro, the other producers on “Trifole” are Casey Diepeveen, Mattia Puleo and John Humber.
During post-production, the “Trifole” team focused on festival outreach and building rapports with distributors. A turning point came during the 2024 European Film Market, where they entered talks with Italy’s Officine UBU, leading to a micro Italian theatrical release on less than 30 screens on Oct. 17, 2024, that yielded $76.740, according to Box Office Mojo.
Subsequent invitations to the Palm Springs and Santa Barbara film festivals opened doors to other U.S. fests, including Miami, Sonoma and Phoenix, generating some U.S. media attention. These festival screenings, combined with the Italian release and positive critical response, led to Cohen Media Group acquiring U.S. distribution rights.
“Trifole” is the latest Italian film release from Cohen Media Group, following the company’s launch of the 2024 Oscar- and Golden Globe-nominated “Io Capitano” by Matteo Garrone.
“Trifole” is also set to be released theatrically in Australia and New Zealand via Hi Gloss Entertainment.
“One thing we’ve been firm on is that we don’t want to go straight to streaming,”  says Gabriele Fabbro. “We want to work with distributors who still believe that cinema should be experienced in theaters. Every partner we’ve chosen shares that vision.”

Hong Kong sales company Cappu Films has picked up Thai Girls’ Love series “ Love Design ” and is introducing the title to buyers at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest ( TCCF ), which is currently taking place.
GL and BL (Boys’ Love) series, which center on same-sex romantic relationships, have become a popular genre across Asia, with Thailand emerging as a major production hub for such content. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Under the arrangement, Cappu Films and VelCurve Studio — the production company behind the sci-fi film “Uranus 2324” — will jointly handle international sales for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, North America, Latin America and Singapore.
Helmed by Fuse Kittisak Cheewasatjasakun, the series follows two female architects, portrayed by Kao Supassara Thanachart and Jane Methika Jiranorraphat, whose romantic relationship deteriorates into professional animosity after one uses the other’s designs in a competition without permission. Popular on Variety
The show debuted Oct. 2 with weekly Thursday releases. Thailand’s Channel 3 is airing an eight-episode version, while Tencent’s WeTV platform carries an extended cut with 10 episodes. Fan events for the final two episodes are planned for early December 2025.
Keetawat Chinnakote, CEO and executive producer at VelCurve Studio, and Janice Woo, founder and head of sales at Cappu Films, negotiated the agreement.
“‘Love Design’ is a GL series that tells the story of the architecture profession — exploring both the challenges of work and the romantic relationships of its characters,” said Keetawat. “It stars the talented Kao Supassara and Jane Methika, alongside promising newcomers Friend Tofan and Palm Paramee. Produced by VelCurve Studio, the series is crafted with a strong commitment to high production standards and storytelling that allows global audiences to easily understand and connect with its context and emotions.”
He characterized the series as Thai soft power content that showcases the country’s creative capabilities internationally, noting his hopes for global audience support through the Cappu Films partnership.
“At Cappu Films, we are passionate about bringing distinctive Asian stories with global resonance to audiences worldwide,” said Woo. “‘Love Design’ is a bold and emotionally layered GL series that combines romance, rivalry, and ambition in a fresh way. Partnering with VelCurve Studio allows us to champion diverse storytelling while tapping into the phenomenal energy of the GL fan community across Asia and beyond.”
Cappu Films handles international sales for emerging directors and commercial genre content. The company’s TCCF slate features the Busan Vision competition winner “Malika” from Kazakhstan, the action-thriller “Fox Hunt” with Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Olga Kurylenko, Josh Radnor’s “All Happy Families,” the Karlovy Vary entry “Promise, I’ll Be Fine” from Aerofilms/Filmtopia, and the Chinese action title “Assassin,” which Film Movement’s Omnibus Entertainment label will distribute in North America.
VelCurve Studio’s previous work includes “Uranus 2324,” which Netflix acquired for its streaming service throughout Southeast Asia, covering Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, East Timor, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and Indonesia.

In a statement, a Square Enix rep said, “We are reorganizing our operations in North America and Europe to strengthen our development structure and to drive a globally integrated marketing strategy,” adding that the layoffs represented “an extremely difficult decision” that will “best position the group’s long-term growth.”
The statement continued: “We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the talented team members who will be departing the company for their significant contributions to Square Enix. During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process.”
For the first six months of 2025, Tokyo-based Square Enix reported revenue of 133.895 billion yen ($875 million), down 15% year over year, and net income of 10.05 billion yen ($66 million), a decline of 14.5%.
Square Enix develops, publishes, distributes and licenses Square Enix and Taito branded entertainment content throughout the Americas. The company’s portfolio of intellectual property includes the “Final Fantasy” franchise, which has sold more than 204 million units worldwide; “Dragon Quest,” which has sold over 95 million units worldwide; and the iconic arcade game “Space Invaders.”

International Features Editor
“1001 Frames,” which screened at Thessaloniki Film Festival this week, is composed of a series of creepy scenes from auditions conducted in Tehran, Iran. But it could be any city.
During the auditions, wannabe actors are asked to improvise scenes including being a cat, being trapped in a room, and being propositioned by a famous director. In fact, the last one is for real as the aspiring thespians eventually discover. It is at that point that the film contorts itself into a horror movie.

In the auditions, the actors are told the film for which they are auditioning is inspired by “One Thousand and One Nights,” also known as “The Arabian Nights,” an Arabic folktale in which the central character, Scheherazade, has to keep her captor, the king, amused by telling him stories so she isn’t killed. Popular on Variety
U.S.-Iranian director Mehrnoush Alia came up with the idea after a conversation with a friend in Iran. “A friend that I knew was trying to become an actress and she was in similar situations,” she says. “She was told: You have to do this in order to get a role, so she gave up on acting and married very young, and became a very depressed woman. Her life changed, like she became a completely different person. So, I watched how, when you kill somebody’s dream, the person completely changes.”
When she moved to the U.S., where she attended Berkeley and Columbia as a film school graduate, she “was in a lot of audition rooms for my own student films and my friends’ student films, for films that were unpaid and by students who didn’t really know what they were doing, and we were getting a lot of applications, like hundreds.
“And just being in that position of power, sitting on the other side of the camera when they walk into the room, very vulnerable, they are opening themselves up, that felt very uncomfortable for me as somebody who has always been on the other side – like my mom is very controlling, I grew up in Iran which is like a very controlling culture obviously, so I think I was kind of identifying with them.”
It also reminded her of an Iranian film, “Salam Cinema,” directed by Mohsen Makhmalbaf, made 30 years ago. She was a kid when she watched it in a cinema with her father in Iran, and it made a big impression on her.
“It happens in an audition room as well. This very famous filmmaker, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who was at the height of his career, put an ad in the newspaper for an audition and thousands of people showed up and they would fight. The way it was done, it was just showing the power of cinema and how desperate people are. The film starts with this long tracking shot, and you watch how they throw application forms in the air and the people were jumping to grab them and fighting over those papers. And in the film, the filmmaker is constantly telling the actors: cry now, laugh now, sing, dance, whatever, and things of that nature, and I remember I felt very uncomfortable in that cinema. I was laughing with the audience. I was having a great time. It’s a very entertaining film, but at the same time it made me feel very uncomfortable, just being aware of this power.”
While she was a student, she started writing a film that she “wanted to be told from the perspective of the audition camera, because I thought that gaze, that male gaze, that we have had in the history of cinema since its beginning, it’s a scary thing for me because I could see how when the actresses come into the room, actors and actresses, they felt vulnerable, and also it reminded me of walking down the streets in Tehran when I was a young woman, and the men are just ogling, just watching you, scanning you from top to toe. It was a cultural thing. I felt like all men feel entitled to do that. So I decided to use that and put the audience in that place, focusing on the discomfort that people feel in front of the camera.”
An added twist in the film is that the man who plays the director is Alia’s partner, Mohammad Aghebati, a theater director in Tehran. Most of the wannabe actresses in the film are played by his students, with whom he has done improvisation, and so he knows their limits, and he’s also the casting director for the film. “I knew a lot of them because we hang out together all the time, so I knew them from social settings,” she said.
“The character is so different from him as a person. He thought he had to be very aggressive and I had to keep reminding him that you are not supposed to be like that. Because he was getting agitated by the role. He really hated his character. So I think he was hiding behind this aggression. But he was starting from an aggressor point of view. I was like, ‘No, these situations usually don’t have that kind of aggression, at least not at the beginning. No, you need to go softer. You need to be more of a smooth talker.’ But he was not getting it. I had to keep reminding him that you have to be a player. He was actually one of the hardest to direct, because he’s a theater director, and he’s such a good director, but it’s hard to direct a director.”
When she’s shown the film, she finds it elicits a strong response in the audience, with both women and men finding that it reminds them of similarly uncomfortable situations.
“Women and men come and talk to me, and a lot of them thank me, because they say they have had similar experiences. Some of them are in tears. And you can just feel the emotion in the room. In the States, I recently screened it at the University of North Carolina for 18 and 19 year old students, all freshmen, at the film school. And it was really interesting to see how American audiences relate to it.
“I was told that 10 of the women were out in the bathroom crying, and the students lined up to talk to me afterwards. Men and women shared their observations. The men I talked to mentioned that they’ve experienced similar situations. But some women have actually gotten deep into what the situation was, you know, and it’s really interesting to see how the work gains their trust. Some of them mentioned that it was a story that they haven’t told anyone. So it was really interesting to just see how it gains their trust and gets them to talk. So, that whole storytelling part of it is interesting.”

Jamie Lee Curtis did not shy away from politics while accepting the Jane Fonda Humanitarian Award at the Women in Film Honors on Thursday at the Beverly Hilton. Grabbing the hand of Fonda, who presented the recognition to Curtis, she referenced the Nov. 4 elections, in which the Democratic Party won key races across the country.
“Since this is women in film, which supports women in an industry that often rejects them — not unlike politics — I am most excited today to stand here two days after the repudiation of the authoritative regime,” Curtis began, then specifically highlighting the victories of “two beautiful women,” New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger.

Curtis also name-checked the newly relaunched Committee for the First Amendment , which Fonda announced the formation of on Oct. 1. Curtis is one of its inaugural members. Popular on Variety
“My father [actor Henry Fonda] was a member of the first Committee for the First Amendment,” Fonda said. “But dig this. That was about one small part of government robbing us of our First Amendment. Right now, it’s the entire federal government. It is far, far worse than what existed back in the ‘40s and ‘50s, and so we have to do something about that.”
Prior to the ceremony, Fonda spoke to Variety about how much she admired Curtis’ activist spirit.
“What really hit me was when the [California wildfires in January] were raging and friends of mine had their houses burning — it was tragic — and then I heard that Jamie Lee gave a million dollars to fire relief , and it just made me cry. It’s such a magnificent gesture, and it so exemplified who she is,” Fonda related.
Curtis has been involved with numerous charitable endeavors, including with Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Project Angel Food, AIDS Walk and her own organization, My Hand in Yours.
Like Fonda, Curtis also was raised by movie star parents, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, and she credited her mother’s own activism for inspiring her. Through the organization SHARE (Share Happily and Reap Endlessly), Leigh helped produce and perform in an annual fundraiser that raised funds to improve the lives of children. In its 73-year history, SHARE has raised over $70 million. Curtis brought an original SHARE member and friend of her mother’s, Dolores Nemiro, to WIF Honors as her date.
“I grew up as a young woman watching this group of women … come together and put on a big effing show to benefit these children,” Curtis explained. “I grew up right away seeing it wasn’t about them … really what I saw was, ‘Oh, you come together with other women to help other people.’ So then when I became an adult, I just mirrored that back to the organizations I’ve been a part of.”
Social justice, women’s equality and the national political climate frequently came up in speeches throughout the evening. In accepting the Crystal Award for TV Advocacy, “Forever” producer Regina King and creator Mara Brock Akil spoke during a panel discussion of the importance of adapting Judy Blume’s seminal 1975 novel for the modern Black experience.
“I think it’s important for us to see how much we are alike, and I think that that’s the reason why people responded to ‘Forever’ the way they did,” King said.
The work of Women in Film was also emphasized throughout the program, particularly in the organization’s work to bring about greater equity for women both in front and behind the camera. The team behind Amazon MGM’s “Hedda,” which received the Crystal Award for Film Advocacy, talked about the impact of having a largely female-led production.
“It’’s so incredible to get to be in the company of so many women that I feel like have been … the prototype for me — that have made me understand what it is that I want, what it is that I can be,” star Tessa Thompson said. “I suppose I hope that we can enter these spaces, not from a place of deep need, but just celebration.”
Maude Apatow was named the Face of the Future. Recently, Apatow finished her directorial debut, “Poetic License,” which premiered to raves at TIFF.
“My favorite woman in film is my mom, Leslie Mann,” Apatow related. “My whole life, I’ve watched her give incredible performances, but nothing could have prepared me for seeing her talent up close when I directed her, her ability to be hilarious, emotional and heartbreaking all at once is mind blowing, the commitment to her craft and the dignity in which she carries herself will always be my North Star.”
Kristin Wiig , who is currently starring and producing the latest season of Apple TV+’s “Palm Royale,” ’ won WIF’s first Icon Award.
“I want to keep telling stories about women with women, and I’m just so happy they keep being told,” Wiig said in her acceptance speech.

Digital News Director
Timothée Chalamet opened up in a new Vogue cover story about his disappointment when it comes to losing awards. The 29-year-old has lost two Oscars, four Golden Globes and four BAFTA Awards, although he did take home the SAG Award for best actor in February thanks to his performance as Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown.” A week later, Adrien Brody (“The Brutalist”) beat him for the Oscar for best actor.
“If there’s five people at an awards show, and four people go home losing, you don’t think those four people are at the restaurant like, ‘Damn, we didn’t win?'” Chalamet told Vogue about being disappointed when he lost at the Oscars. “I’ve been around some deeply generous, no-ego actors, and maybe some of them are going, ‘That was fun.’ But I know for a fact a lot of them are going, ‘Fuck!’ ” Popular on Variety Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
“People can call me a try-hard, and they can say whatever the fuck,” Chalamet added. “But I’m the one actually doing it here.”
Last year, Chalamet touched on what it’s like to lose at awards shows when he told SiriusXM that it’s “uniquely hilarious” to go home empty handed and then have to rip up the awards speech you wrote before the ceremony. He added: “You think to yourself, ‘You narcissistic arrogant prick. On what planet did you think you were gonna use this?'”
While Chalamet has always looked up to actors who “keep things tight-lipped” by avoiding the press and remaining enigmas, he has started to become a lot more forthcoming when it comes to publicity. As Vogue recounted : “When he was promoting ‘A Complete Unknown,’ Chalamet sat down with manosphere podcast hosts and met YouTube stars. He attended his own look-alike contest. He has no interest in making prestige films for a vanishing population.”
For the upcoming “ Marty Supreme ,” in theaters this Christmas from A24, Chalamet has kicked off the press tour with viral videos featuring men wearing giant ping pong helmets. These mascots even followed Chalamet to a surprise screening of the film in New York City. When he won the SAG Award earlier this year, Chalamet told the room that he is in “pursuit of greatness.” He is not hiding that he cares anymore.
“You don’t want to risk being too declarative,” he told Vogue. “But I also don’t want to look back on life and things I’ve put out and go, ‘Oh, little old me. Hey, see the movie if you want. It is what it is.’ No. At worst, you’ve rubbed people the wrong way. And at best, someone will get pulled in and go, ‘Hey, this guy really thinks this thing’s worthy.’ ”
Chalamet is already earning Oscar buzz for “Marty Supreme,” with Variety calling him a best actor frontrunner . This means his future slate likely includes many of the awards shows he’s become a regular at in recent years. He’s also developing a motocross movie, “High Side,” with his “A Complete Unknown” director James Mangold, plus he’s filming “Dune: Part Three” with Denis Villeneuve. One thing Chalamet is not planning on doing next is TV, despite getting his start as a young actor on Showtime’s “Homeland.” He’s never gone back to television despite many of his A-list peers taking on buzzy limited series. Asked about making another TV show, Chalamet bluntly responded: “No.”

TV Business Writer
The world of Wordle is expanding: The New York Times Games is launching a “Create Your Wordle Puzzle” feature that will allow users to go beyond just playing the popular word game, and instead develop their own one-word challenges.
Debuting Thursday, Create Your Wordle Puzzle will let All Access and Games subscribers “turn inside jokes, special moments, or personal messages” into a 4-7 letter solution with a “created by” label and an optional clue, all done via the New York Times Games app on iOS and Android, as well as mobile web and desktop. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
However, not every word can be Wordled. Popular on Variety
Per the New York Times Games’ acceptable use policy for Create Your Wordle Puzzle, users are prohibited from including the following in their customized puzzles: name-calling, personal attacks, slurs, harassment, threats, hate speech, bullying, abuse, malicious acts, descriptions of violence or gore, and discrimination, as well as profanity (including expletives and letters followed by dashes that could translate to an expletive) and content that is sexual, salacious, obscene, or predatory, including grooming behaviors.
The new Wordle offering comes at a time of continuous growth for the NYT Games division. In Q3, helped by its exclusive games lineup, the New York Times added 460,000 net digital-only subscribers , bringing the total to 12.33 million.
“The Games team has wanted to do this for some time,” The New York Times Games chief Jonathan Knight told Variety . “We also talk to our users regularly, and take their temperature on what they’d like to see from us. And now that Wordle has a collection of great features surrounding it, like the Wordle Archive of over 1500 puzzles, plus WordleBot’s post-game analysis, we knew the time was right to deliver Create Your Wordle Puzzle.”
Once a Create Your Wordle Puzzle is crafted, the creator will receive a unique URL that will let them share the custom puzzle with others. Notably, this feature allows non-subscribers to play puzzles created by subscribers.
“We think there’s a lot of value in the creation part of the experience, and understand that our most dedicated fans are the most likely to be the Create Your Wordle Puzzle makers,” Knight said. “But we also want as many people as possible within those fans’ networks (big or small) to enjoy the solving side of that same experience. This will make it the most satisfying for everyone.”
At this time, Knight says the NYT Games team is “not looking” at creating custom versions of its other products — which include the Crossword, Connections, Spelling Bee, Pips and more games — and is instead focused on the Create Your Wordle launch. “It’s just the beginning, and we’re excited to learn and to see what people create!” Knight said.
To coincide with the launch of Create Your Wordle Puzzle, The New York Times curated the below list of custom puzzles from nine prominent NYT staffers across the newsroom and verticals including Audio, Cooking, Games, Wirecutter and The Athletic:

Here’s something that will be interesting to screenwriters.
John August, the co-host of the “Scriptnotes” podcast, has been named a co-chair of the negotiating committee for the Writers Guild of America. The other co-chair is Danielle Sanchez-Witzel, the showrunner of the Netflix series “Survival of the Thickest.”
The WGA is set to begin bargaining next spring for the first time since the five-month writers strike in 2023. The current deal expires on May 1, 2026.

As in 2023, the chief negotiator for the writers will be Ellen Stutzman, who is also the executive director of WGA West. She will be negotiating with Greg Hessinger, the new president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Popular on Variety
August and Sanchez-Witzel each served on the negotiating committee in 2023. The co-chairs last time around, Chris Keyser and David Goodman, will not be involved this time.
The WGA released a list of 29 committee members, including Mike Schur (“A Man on the Inside,” “Parks and Recreation”), Shawn Ryan (“The Night Agent,” “S.W.A.T.”) and Tom Fontana (“Homicide: Life on the Street,” “Borgia.”)
The committee has seen a fair amount of turnover. Ten of the 30 members of the 2023 committee will participate this time. One of those is Michele Mulroney, who served as vice president of WGA West in 2023 and was recently elected president.
Among the top issues on the agenda will the WGA pension and health plans, which are facing a potential shortfall that will need to be addressed.
The 2026 committee members: John August, Danielle Sanchez-Witzel, Ali Barthwell, Yahlin Chang, Stan Chervin, Larry J. Cohen, Josh Gondelman, Phil Hay, Eric Haywood, Chris Hazzard, Melissa London Hilfers, Christopher Kyle, Molly Nussbaum, Luvh Rakhe, Shawn Ryan, Betsy Thomas, Danny Tolli, Erica Saleh, Mike Schur, Cat Vasko, Ben Watkins, Kat Wood, Lisa Zwerling.

Kim Kardashian shrugged off the scathing reviews of her new legal drama, “All’s Fair,” with a playful Instagram post on Thursday night.
In the carousel post, Kardashian included screenshots of posts on X (formerly Twitter) both criticizing and praising the show, including one that read, “Some of the worst acting I’ve ever seen in my life alongside the most predictable storylines and the most ridiculous styling. I’m obsessed I need 14 seasons.” Related Stories George Clooney Says It Was a 'Mistake' to Have Kamala Harris Replace Joe Biden in the 2024 Presidential Election: 'She Was Given a Very Tough Ask' K-Pop Animated Feature 'Rainmakers,' 'The Nut Job 3' on RedRover's AFM Slate (EXCLUSIVE)
“Have you tuned in to the most critically acclaimed show of the year!?!?!?” Kardashian wrote in the caption. Popular on Variety
Created by Ryan Murphy, “All’s Fair” stars Kardashian as Allura Grant, who teams up with fellow divorce attorneys to open an all-female practice in L.A. The cast also includes Naomi Watts, Niecy Nash-Betts, Teyana Taylor, Sarah Paulson and Glenn Close.
The series, which premiered on Hulu on Nov. 4, received a wave of negative reviews from critics and TV journalists.
Variety ‘s TV critic Alison Herman wrote in her review , “‘All’s Fair’ is a clumsy, condescending take on rah-rah girlboss feminism, half-baked even by the standards of an overextended Murphy, who co-created the show with Joe Baken and Jon Robin Baitz. It’s true that the tone is intentionally camp-adjacent, and if one squints they could discern the vague outlines of a parody. But that’s little consolation when “All’s Fair” demonstrates such a low opinion of its own viewers, assuming we’ll bark like seals when fed disconnected scraps of sassy one-liners, flashy outfits and men-ain’t-shit commiseration.”
In The Times’ zero-star review of the series, headlined “All’s Fair review: this may be the worst TV drama ever,” deputy TV editor Ben Dowell wrote: “Well done, Kim. You must have quite a healthy ego yourself to star in what may well be the worst television drama ever made. Because ‘All’s Fair’ (Disney+) is so bad, it’s not even enjoyably so. It thinks it’s a feminist fable about spirited lawyers getting their own back on cruel rich men but is in fact a tacky and revolting monument to the same greed, vanity and avarice it supposedly targets. All scripted, it feels, by a toddler who couldn’t write ‘bum’ on a wall.”
Several X posts featured in Kardashian’s Instagram post defended “All’s Fair” from the critics’ reactions, with one user writing, “Critics realizing their reviews of [‘All’s Fair’] ended up making people watch and love the show.”
“‘All’s Fair’ on Hulu dares to ask the question ‘Does a show need to be good?” & the answer is no, it doesn’t,” another X user wrote. “We have legendary actresses here giving the worst performances of their careers, it takes a special kind of talent to pull that kind of inability out of them. Amazeballs.”
“All’s Fair” marks Kardashian’s second collaboration with Murphy after starring in the 12th season of “American Horror Story,” subtitled “Delicate.” The reality star also serves as an executive producer on the legal drama alongside Murphy.

By John Hopewell
Chief International Correspondent
“My parents didn’t just argue,” Carmela confides in her best friend at school, her face darkening. But she doesn’t go into detail.
“Have you ever seen your dad act violent? Has he ever treated your badly?” a judge asks Carmela later in the film, in a crux scene caught in a new teaser trailer for “The Good Daughter,” from Catalan Júlia de Paz Solvas. The teaser does not capture Carmela’s reply.

Sold by Beta Cinema , The Good Daughter” world premieres in main competition at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, which runs Nov. 7-23. It begins with Carmela meeting her father in a secured room to ensure he will not meet her mother, who drops her off. Carmela loves both parents, idolizes her father, who is preparing an art exhibition, wants to remain loyal to him, whatever he does, whatever her own cost. Popular on Variety
What he does do to Carmela, in psychological and physical terms, exacts a tremendous emotional toil on her, which she tries to bear in silence.
Co-written with Núria Dunjó Lopez (“Ama,” “Jone Sometimes”), “The Good Daughter” marks the second feature by De Paz Solvas, a Variety 2021 Spanish Talent to Track whose debut “Ama” won …. She leapt to much further prominence this year for co-writing “Querer,” which won this year the top Grand Prix at Series Mania, Europe’s biggest TV  festival.
There have been any films on gender violence but “what’s most notable about ‘The Good Daughter’ is without doubt its viewpoint. The cinema I like most are films that present viewpoints that I’d never really thought about before,” says Sergio Grobas, the film’s producer at Barcelona-based Astra Pictures, which co-produced with Madrid’s Avalon Pictures and Belgium’s Kratin Films.
Variety sat down with De Paz Solvas in the run-up to the Black Nights Films Festival, where “The Good Daughter” is one of the big highlights among new films, at a Focus on Catalonia, dedicated by Tallinn Festival at a territory which has taken festivals by storm while emerging as a extraordinarily fertile co-production force in Europe and Latin America.
The teaser you’ve chosen to publish with Variety drives at the heart of the film: its exploration of gender violence from a not-so-often-considered angle of a daughter? How did you come to explore it?
If we want to talk about an issue, Nuria, the film’s co-screenwriter, and I always begin by research, which in this case took more or less four or five years. I wanted to explore gender-based violence. So we began to interview its victims, survivors. Talking with them, we realized that the large majority were hugely worried about their children which in a large majority of cases were not considered victims since they hadn’t suffered direct physical nor sexual violence from the abuser, their father. As a militant feminist, I was surprised I hadn’t thought about this… .
The sons and daughters don’t receive psychological counselling?
At both a judicial and social level when it’s a case of psychological violence, it’s difficult for it to be considered violence since it’s subtler, if I can use that description. Since there isn’t evidence which proves violence, which can be the case with physical or sexual abuse, it’s more difficult for it to be considered violence. What we found is that the Spanish justice prioritises the role of the pater families, the father, rather than the figure of an abuser.
And you talked to the children of victims of gender-based violence?
Yes, the mothers asked their children – who were normally around the age of Carmela in the film – if they wanted to be interviewed. We interviewed sons and daughters, letting them talk about what they were comfortable about. What they said enriched the screenplay. Also the screenplay was revised by Raúl Lizana,  one of Spain’s leading authorities on vicarious violence – when an aggressor who does not have direct access to the woman he wants to harm exercises that violence on significant persons for her.
Did you interview aggressors?
We met with men who had been jailed for gender-based violence. It’s very easy to fall into clichés. We wanted to show they are not always monsters but have cycles of violence which means that at times they can be spontaneous, seductive, that there are moments of light. We wanted to create this sense of duality of the moments when Carmela is with her father, and in a certain way enamoured of him. We’d like spectators to understand that there’s no specific figure of a victim of gender-based violence, that it’s far more complicated that we are given to believe.
In the film’s first half-hour or so, you understand that the father has been guilty of gender-based violence but you don’t see it. That builds tension and suspense.…
Yes, there’s a certain similarity with “Querer”: That spectators have to fill in the gaps and be asked to doubt a kind of violence which isn’t that clear. In the scene at the swimming pool, it’s not quite totally clear if this was a game that they’d just seen. In “Querer,” for example, we didn’t want to show the husband’s attacks but rather the post.
What were your guidelines as a director?
I wanted to follow Carmela at every moment, without judging her, and also that the film would travel between darkness and light, a light captured for example in the relationship with her friends or with the first kiss. We also wanted to play with spaces. I asked Victor Santacana, our art director, to work in a way that, even if Carmela wasn’t in a space, she would be for the spectator.
And do you sense that you form part of a a new generation of Catalan filmmakers who have broken trough in the last 10 years and are often women?
At a conscious level, maybe not so much but it’s true that I feel part o0f a network which we’ve all built together. Eva Libertad (“Deaf”),  Gemma Blasco (“La Furia”), or Sara Fantova of “Jone, Sometimes” are my friends. I’ve grown up with them. If I have questions I’ll ask the or other friends. For example, Alauda Ruiz de Azúa, writer-director of “Querer,” helped me with the editing of “The Good Daughter.” We have this support network between us.

Meryl Streep and Sigourney Weaver have been cast in Joseph Cedar’s “ Useful Idiots ,” a provocative thriller set in New York City.
“Useful Idiots” follows veteran journalist Diane Castle (Streep) as she “covers the New York luxury property market, disillusioned with writing puff pieces about the wealthy elite, and feeling regretful that she may not have lived up to her potential. When a record-breaking sale of a new penthouse hits her desk, Diane’s questions about the buyer’s identity lead to what could be the story of a lifetime. At its center is a mysterious oligarch, whose influence stretches across Manhattan and beyond – protected by a network of fixers, enablers and a brilliant young strategist. Out of her depth, Diane digs deeper into the investigation, her determination to uncover the truth revealing a web of corruption and danger at the highest levels, ensnaring Diane, her family, and all those around her.” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)

“Kill Bill” fans have some unfinished business. Lionsgate has released a trailer for its coming theatrical release of Quentin Tarantino ‘s “The Whole Bloody Affair,” the four-hour cut  (281 minutes with a 15 minute intermission) that combines “Kill Bill Vol. 1” and “Kill Bill Vol. 2″ into a single feature. The epic-length edition of the action classic had been vaulted for years until this coming rollout, which marks its first ever theatrical release.
Lionsgate will put out “The Whole Bloody Affair” on Dec. 5, with plans to play all major markets in North America. The distribution plan also includes speciality screenings in 35mm and 70mm — prints that were likely newly struck for this release. When “The Whole Bloody Affair” played the Tarantino-owned Vista Theater in Los Angeles as an eventized limited run last summer, the theater projected his personal print made for the cut’s Cannes premiere in 2006, which included French subtitles and all. Showtimes also featured an intermission between the events of “Vol. 1” and “Vol. 2.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“Kill Bill” was originally conceived and filmed as a single feature, but was split into two installments to accommodate its expansive runtime. The parts were released six months apart, in October 2003 and April 2004, collectively grossing more than $330 million worldwide. Tarantino later premiered “The Whole Bloody Affair” two years later at Cannes. The edition wouldn’t screen again until 2011, when it played the director’s own New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles. It was then vaulted again until the Vista run in July. Popular on Variety

Digital News Director
Jennifer Lawerence appeared on the “Las Culturistas” podcast during her “ Die My Love ” press tour and revealed she did not need to use an intimacy coordinator while filming the movie’s sex scenes with co-star Robert Pattinson . The Lynne Ramsay-directed psychodrama stars Lawrence as woman who descends into psychosis after the birth of her child. Pattinson plays the character’s increasingly useless husband.
“We did not have [an intimacy coordinator], or maybe we did but we didn’t really… I felt really safe with Rob,” Lawrence told the podcast hosts. “He is not pervy and very in love with [partner] Suki Waterhouse. We mostly were just talking about our kids and relationships. There was never any weird like, ‘Does he think I like him?’ If there was a little bit of that I would probably have an intimacy coordinator. A lot of male actors get offended if you don’t want to fuck them, and then the punishment starts. He was not like that.” Popular on Variety Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Lawrence, who has received universal acclaim and Oscar buzz for her performance in “Die My Live,” also appears nude in the movie, which she filmed while pregnant with her second child. During a recent screening of the movie (via Vulture ), the Oscar winner said she allowed herself to be naked on camera without giving any thought to how she might look. This was a change of pace from when Lawrence went full frontal in the R-rated comedy “No Hard Feelings” and exercised hard before filming.
“I don’t care about nudity. I’m not sensitive about it,” Lawrence said. “I wanted Lynne to have total freedom artistically… I think being pregnant took a lot of, like, vanity anxiety away. Before ‘No Hard Feelings,’ I was dieting and not eating carbs and working out. I was pregnant [for ‘Die My Love’]. Like, what was I gonna do? Not eat? I was working 15 hours a day. I was just tired… I remember, like, them sending over a close-up of cellulite and being like, ‘Do you want us to touch this up?’ And I was like, ‘No. That’s an ass.'”
“Die My Love” opens in theaters Nov. 7 from Mubi. Listen to Lawrence’s full interview on the “Las Culturistas” podcast here.

Personnaz plays a French President whose life is turned upside down when an eight-year-old girl goes missing. “While the public is shocked over the disappearance of the young girl, the tragedy affects the President personally as she is his illegitimate daughter, born of a secret affair unknown to his wife and confidante Nora (Kruger). When the kidnapping becomes a matter of state, the entire Elysée apparatus intervenes to find the little girl.

The Mise-En-Scène Company has acquired worldwide sales rights to “ Billy Knight ,” a meta drama starring Al Pacino , ahead of next week’s American Film Market ( AFM ).
The acquisition marks a significant expansion for the boutique sales company, following its recent pickup of David Krumholtz’s “Forelock.” The deal, estimated to be in the eight-figure range, positions “Billy Knight” as a major addition to MSC’s 2025 slate as the company continues its push into prestige, star-driven cinema.

Marking the directorial debut of Alec Griffen Roth, “Billy Knight” follows aspiring filmmakers Alex (Charlie Heaton of “Stranger Things”) and Emily ( Diana Silvers of “Booksmart” ) as they navigate the path between youthful ambition and true artistic expression. When Alex discovers a box of unfinished scripts and a handkerchief bearing the name “Billy Knight,” he sets out to unravel his late father’s creative legacy. Popular on Variety
Pacino stars as the enigmatic titular figure, described as part muse, part ghost of cinema past. Sara Sampaio (“Superman”) and Angela Sarafyan (“Westworld,” “Superman”) round out the ensemble.
The film hails from Firebrand, a next-generation entertainment group launched in March 2022 and led by Alec Roth, Josh Clayton, Kirk Martin, Tuan Bui and Peter Morgan. The company’s debut feature, “Desert Road,” will be released theatrically by Firebrand in 2026.
“Firebrand is all about purposeful disruption,” said producer Clayton. “We stand for innovation, imagination, and intelligence, signing with MSC is proof of that. ‘Billy Knight’ takes this spirit and channels it into something timeless.”
Kirk Martin, Firebrand co-founder, added: “Cinema is about legacy and reinvention in equal measure. ‘Billy Knight’ is both a love letter to those who dare to dream and a challenge to those who forget why they did.”
Paul Yates, CEO of The Mise-En-Scène Company, said: “‘Billy Knight’ is a beautiful homage to the love of cinema. Pacino has been woven into our collective screen experience for half a century, and we are honored to be representing a masterful performance from one of the greats. This film is intimate yet epic, nostalgic yet alive with modern pulse.”
The deal was brokered by Paul Yates and Rory MacDonald for The Mise-En-Scène Company, which is launching world sales at AFM.

Senior Editor, Culture and Events
The Duffer brothers , Matt and Ross, call the upcoming theatrical release of “Stranger Things” is “dream” come true.
As previously reported, the two-hour series finale of the series – the last episode titled “The Rightside Up” — will premiere on Netflix and in more than 350 movie theaters on Dec. 31, starting at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET, playing through Jan. 1. This marks the first time an episode of a Netflix series will also be exhibited theatrically.

“This has been a dream of ours for a while,” Ross told me Thursday night at the world premiere of the series’ fifth and final season at the TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood.
Netflix announced the plans just days after Variety published an interview with Netflix’s chief content officer Bela Bajaria in which she insisted the streamer had no plans to release “ Stranger Things ” in theaters. “A lot of people — a lot, a lot, a lot of people — have watched ‘Stranger Things’ on Netflix,” she said. “It has not suffered from lack of conversation or community or sharing or fandom. I think releasing it on Netflix is giving the fans what they want.”
Praising Bajaria for her “poker face,” Matt said, “Ross and I just folded. The truth is…this was in the works for a long time. Netflix came to us with the idea. It was their idea to have the finale on a separate day and we thought that was cool, specifically because we thought we could pitch this movie theater idea, which we had never pitched before, honestly.”
He continued, “It never really made sense to us because everyone will always ask about it. I’m like, ‘Well, it’s kind of not fun because no one’s in sync. People will have seen the episode, some people won’t have seen the episode, it’s not the same. This actually recreates and is a real movie moment because everyone’s experiencing it at the same time together. I think that’s what we’re excited about it and it’s the first time we had that opportunity.”
Star Millie Bobby Brown explained that she wore a black custom Rodarte gown to the premiere as an homage to the end of the series. “It’s for the funeral of the show,” she said. “This dress kind of embodies the darkness of the show this season. I’m really excited for everyone to see how dark it gets. I hate to say it because I say it every season, but this is definitely the darkest and the more intense season.”

Digital News Director
Jennifer Lawrence recently told Vulture during a post-screening Q&A for “ Die My Love ” that she feels a noticeable difference when she’s working with a female director compared to a male director. “Die My Love” was helmed by Lynne Ramsay . Other female filmmakers in Lawrence’s filmography include Debra Granik (“Winter’s Bone”), Jodie Foster (“The Beaver”), Susanne Bier (“Serena”) and Lila Neugebauer (“Causeway”).
“I have found a commonality in female directors, which is that they do not do this thing, which is over-direct,” the Oscar winner noted. “There have been some times when I’ve worked with male directors where there’s this need to constantly feel like they’re directing the movie. And it’s not even really getting anything done. It’s just annoying. When I think auteur , my mind kind of goes to controlling and … what’s that word? Neurotic!” Popular on Variety Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“And Lynne was the opposite,” Lawrence continued. “She really built this world and made sure that we were all on the same page, through music and conversations and the atmosphere and the set. And then she would just kind of slowly walk back. And sometimes, from the discomfort of that, from the lack of her visibility, something interesting would come from it. And then she would come out and be like, ‘That’s great, great, yeah, do it again.’ Or we would accidentally laugh and be like, ‘Oh, sorry.’ And she’d be like, ‘No, it was great. I liked that you laughed. Do it again.'”
“Die My Love,” based on Ariana Harwicz’s 2012 novel of the same name, stars Lawrence as a woman plunged into psychosis amid a loveless marriage following the birth of her child. Robert Pattinson, LaKeith Stanfield, Nick Nolte and Sissy Spacek co-star.
Ramsay told Vulture that her directing style on the movie was born of wanting the actors to feel free on the set.
“I love working with actors. When you really trust each other, something just happens that’s magical,” Ramsay said. “So sometimes I’d let the take run long. There’s a kind of discomfort in that. It’s like, ‘What the hell did we do now?; But then something happens sometimes. I gave them the space in that house to just explore and go in and out of doors. There was one scene where Grace is just bored in the house and there’s that laundry basket, and I didn’t ask her to tip it over with her toe, but there’s a kind of rage in that.”
“Die My Love” opens in theaters Nov. 7 from Mubi.

Lee Tamahori , the New Zealand director behind acclaimed Kiwi drama “Once Were Warriors” alongside blockbuster Hollywood titles such as the James Bond film “Die Another Day,” has died. He was 75.
Tamahori’s family said the director passed away following a battle with Parkinson’s disease.
“His legacy endures with his whānau, his mokopuna, every filmmaker he inspired, every boundary he broke and every story he told with his genius eye and honest heart,” the family said in a statement to New Zealand public service broadcaster RNZ.

Born in Wellington in 1950, and of Māori descent through his father and British ancestry via his mother, Tamahori made an immediate impact with his directorial debut 1994’s “Once Were Warriors.” An unapologetic and raw portrayal of Māori life, it became a landmark of New Zealand cinema and established him as an exciting new voice in the industry. Popular on Variety
Hollywood soon came calling, and Tamahori later directed 1997 survival thriller “The Edge” starring Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin, following by 2001’s “Along Came a Spider.” Then in 2002 came his biggest feature, “Die Another Day,” the last of Pierce Brosnan’s Bond films that also starred Halle Berry (and had a cameo from Madonna). Although Tamahori’s direction was praised, the film received mixed reviews. But it still amassed $432 million at the global box office.
Tamahori’s following films — “XXX: State of the Union,” “Next” and “The Devil’s Double” — didn’t manage to achieve the same impact, with disappointing theatrical results. After a period of relative quiet, he returned to filmmaking in his homeland with 2016’s “Mahana” and “The Convert” in 2023.

TV Reporter
An American version of “ Call My Agent ” is currently in development at HBO , Variety has learned.
While the original French series “Call My Agent” (a.k.a. “Dix pour cent”) was set at a fictional talent agency in Paris, the American version will be set at a sports agency. The official logline states, “Four work-obsessed sports agents struggle to balance their personal lives and their clients’ needs in an industry where, more and more, it feels like being an athlete is just the start.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Sarah Schneider is attached to write and executive produce the HBO version. Plan B will executive produce along with Fulwell Entertainment’s SpringHill Studios. Plan B is majority owned by French media conglomerate Mediawan and counts Brad Pitt among its co-founders, while SpringHill was co-founded by NBA great LeBron James. Fulwell 73 and SpringHill completed their merger earlier this year. Popular on Variety
“Dix pour cent” originally debuted on France 2 in 2015 and starred Camille Cottin, Thibault de Montalembert, Grégory Montel, Liliane Rovère, Fanny Sidney, Laure Calamy, Nicolas Maury, and Stéfi Celma. Following the show’s successful launch in France, Netflix bought it and renamed it “Call My Agent.” Four seasons have aired to date, with a fifth season and a Netflix movie on the way .
This would be the latest in a string of international adaptation of “Call My Agent.” There have been versions set in Turkey, India, Germany, the U.K., and Korea, among others, while it was recently reported that a Chinese version is in the works .
Interestingly, should the project go to series, it would be the third HBO show set in the world of sports representation. The premium cabler most recently aired the comedy “Ballers” starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson for five seasons between 2015 and 2019, which focused on financial managers for athletes. Prior to that, Robert Wuhl starred as fictional sports agent Arliss Michaels in the comedy series “Arliss” at HBO for seven seasons from 1996-2002.
Schneider previously co-created the popular comedy series “The Other Two” alongside Chris Kelly. The show originally debuted on Comedy Central before moving to HBO Max for its final two seasons. She and Kelly received two Emmy nominations for best writing for a comedy series for their work on the show. Schneider was also previously a writer at “Saturday Night Live,” with she and Kelly serving as co-head writers for the NBC sketch comedy show’s 42nd season. She received eight Emmy nominations in total for her time at “SNL.” Her other writing credits include new HBO comedy “The Chair Company,” “Master of None” at Netflix, and CollegeHumor.
She is repped by UTA.

There’s a new Dumbledore at Hogwarts, and fans of the medical drama “House” will surely recognize the voice.
Hugh Laurie is putting on the wizard robes of Album Dumbledore in Audible ‘s “ Harry Potter ” audio book series. “The Sorcerer’s Stone,” the first book in the lauded franchise, is now available to listen to on Audible, and each subsequent book will release each month.
The “House” star is one of many Hollywood actors recruited for this new telling of “Harry Potter.” The Hogwarts staff is filled with Riz Ahmed as Prof. Snape, Kit Harington as Gilderoy Lockhart, Keira Knightley as Dolores Umbridge, James McAvoy as Mad-Eye Moody, Michelle Gomez as Prof. McGonagall and many more. Harry, Ron and Hermione are played by newcomers Frankie Treadaway, Max Lester and Arabella Stanton — who’s also starring as Hermione in HBO’s upcoming TV series. The trio of youngsters will play the leads in the first three books, and then Jaxon Knopf, Rhys Mulligan and Nina Barker-Francis will take over for the final four novels.

With Variety , Laurie discusses finding his voice for Dumbledore, joining the “dynasty” of actors playing the wise wizard and why he’s glad he didn’t have to audition for the role. Popular on Variety
Before you reel in amazement, I will have to confess to you that I did not read the books. But before you fall over, I’ll tell you why that was. My longtime friend, colleague and incidentally godfather to my three children, Stephen Fry, did the U.K. audio book. On long car journeys to back and forth to Scotland, my three children insisted on hearing their godfather read the book, so I felt like I’d become fairly expert without ever actually seeing it written on a page. I hope you will not take that as a lack of commitment or enthusiasm. I greatly enjoyed his performance, although 7,000 hours of Stephen Fry talking at me is — well, I was getting up to the limit by the end.
I did, I read them in manuscript form for the way we recorded. It was very enjoyable to revisit that world, very stirring, funny, emotional and mythic in its way. It was a great honor to be part of it.
I was deeply conscious of the lineage, starting, obviously, with Richard Harris, then Michael Gambon, Jude Law, Jim Dale and Stephen Fry. It’s quite a dynasty to join. It was the humility. This wise, gentle character had been inhabited and portrayed by such eminent people. It was incredibly flattering to be invited to follow on. My first thought was, “Don’t mess it up. Don’t let these people down.” That is my overriding thought when taking on any acting engagement. Someone said to me recently, “My whole goal in with every acting job is to avoid shame.” And that that sums up my position, too.
I didn’t want to be different for difference’s sake. I suppose I was sort of influenced by all of them, particularly by Stephen because his voice was still ringing in my ears years later. There were moments when I caught myself doing inflections. I caught myself almost doing an impression of Stephen, because I thought some of his inflections were so perfect that I had to guard against that. That would become weird to have me doing an impression of him. I suppose he was probably the biggest influence, but they were all influences. They all brought a gravity of kindness and wisdom to the role. That had to remain. I was not going to go punk on Dumbledore. I don’t think that would satisfy anybody.
I did not. I feel slightly ashamed that I was not tested. I should have been tested, but no, I didn’t. One of the great privileges of having been in this business for so long is that people know who you are know and what you can do. You are spared very often the mortifying embarrassment of actually trying to sell yourself to a producer or a director, especially because I’m so terribly bad at it. I think I only have got two roles in 40 years by auditioning. I’m just really, really bad at it. I think most actors would say that they find it a pretty horrible process. Some enjoy it, I think, but not many.
It felt like we were doing it for so long that my age was tracking his. By the time I finished, I felt like we’d been doing it for 25 years. As time goes on, he becomes a little more frail and croakier. You never know how people are going to listen to these things, whether they’re going to listen in one mad weekend where they take ayahuasca and do it whole. Kids, don’t do that. You never know whether people are going to listen to it over a protracted period. It may be that people will listen to it over a year, five years. It could be anything.
My suspicion is that J.K. Rowling had deliberately set out to create an amalgam of many characters who have appeared in these stories over the years. I could imagine John Gielgud or Michael Redgrave or people like that lending their gravitas and their beautifully projected tones. They all went to drama school where they learned that stuff — I didn’t. I think it’s a mixture of many different sources that she was influenced by.
The weird thing about tongue twisters is that they can come out of nowhere, like a horse who won’t go over a jump. It could be the lowest jump on the whole course, and suddenly you can’t say, “It isn’t, is it?” It can be the simplest thing, and it comes out of nowhere. You look at these great, long, complicated pieces of prose and think it’s going to be a mouthful and that seems to come out fine. But the really simple thing can sometimes trip you up, and you don’t know why and you feel people’s eyes rolling on the other side of the glass. Oh my god, is this guy ever going to get it right? But eventually you do.
It all went a bit vague in my head in the middle of it. We were all sitting in the studio thinking, “How long we’ve been here. Is it it a day or is it a year and a half? We can’t really tell.” They were quite long days, quite intense. I was probably going in for about two weeks, but they were long days with a lot to get through, but a wonderful crew of people helping to put it together. Then, of course, it was very fastidious and carefully thought-out editing. They put the whole thing together from the assembled bits, because they record every actor separately. It’s one of the great shames about this process that you don’t get to interact with the other actors, because it’s such a magnificent cast. It’s a gargantuan undertaking with the care and precision of the recordings and soundscape that they’ve generated, because it’s a strange hybrid. This is not a narrated novel, and yet it’s neither a dramatization. It’s a mixture of the two.

Nearly half of Gen Z say that YouTube or social video platforms are their preferred entertainment platforms over traditional TV or paid streaming.
According to Activate Consulting’s Technology & Media Outlook 2026 , which was unveiled by CEO Michael Wolf at the WSJ Tech Live event on Wednesday, 43% of Gen Z are opting for YouTube and TikTok for their media and news consumption.
Per the same survey, the popularity of “ microdramas ” — one of the latest trends on those platforms, consisting of 1-2 minute scripted episodes of an ongoing storyline — has been increasing at a fast rate with 28 million U.S. adults (52% aged 18-34) reportedly watching that new form of content.

Additional findings include projections for global internet and media revenue to increase by $388 billion by 2029, while average daily time spent streaming video will climb to 4 hours and 8 minutes as time spent watching traditional TV is set to collapse to just 1 hour and 17 minutes.
Activate estimates that, as a result, streaming revenues (from ads and subscriptions) will grow 18-19% annually while traditional TV revenues will fall 4-6% year to year.
According to the consulting firm’s report, people are currently living a “32-hour, 17-minute day” by multitasking throughout their daily routine online, and consumers spend over 13 hours on media daily by utilizing various social media platforms like Instagram, X, and TikTok. To capitalize on this trend, companies like Amazon are moving into creating more video content, alongside streaming services like Spotify moving to creating audiobooks.

Coca wants to live in a city she can afford.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Yes, he said that. No word if he has a policy statement on rent-controlled catios. Popular on Variety
Also in the episode, Mamdani dances a few beats of the Dominican dance Bachata and says, “I love bodega cats. And I also love an egg and cheese on a roll with jalapeños.”
The episode is available on TikTok and Instagram at @shopcats.
“Shop Cats” is a consistent viral hit with more than 793,400 followers on TikTok and 228,000 on Instagram.
Separate from the show, there also happens to be a Cats4Zohran Instagram account with about 11,000 followers. Its bio reads, “Cats catvassing for Zohran! A livable NYC = safer affordable homes + more treats!”
In comparison, a Dogs4Zohran Instagram only has 708 followers.
Mamdani is leading in the polls to win the three-way race for mayor against former New York governor and independent candidate Andrew M. Cuomo and Republican activist Curtis Sliwa.
In addition to “Shop Cats,” Mad Realities is also behind “Hollywood IQ,” an on-the-street trivia showdown for pop culture obsessives, rewarding the “human IMDbs” who can identify celebrity faces or match films to their box office grosses.

NY Digital Editor
Amazon is letting advertisers get their audio spots in front of more ears through an expanded pact with iHeartMedia for programmatic ads.
Under the deal, users of the Amazon DSP (demand side platform) ad-buying system now have access to inventory on iHeartMedia’s streaming music and livestreaming radio channels. In 2026, Amazon DSP will add iHeartPodcasts and iHeartMedia’s broadcast radio stations. In the U.S., iHeartMedia is the biggest radio broadcaster, operating more than 870 owned stations in 160 markets.

The expanded partnership with iHeartMedia comes after Amazon landed a similar pact with Spotify covering programmatic ad inventory. Amazon DSP also provides access to inventory in Amazon Music. Popular on Variety
Amazon Ads and iHeartMedia have already been working together for the past decade. The two companies have developed advertising solutions spanning smart devices, mobile apps and voice technology — and now they’re diving into programmatic audio advertising, which lets buyers target audiences based on demographics, shopping patterns or other attributes.
“Our partnership with iHeart allows Amazon DSP customers to reach relevant audio audiences with simplified campaign management and unique measurement capabilities,” said Amazon Ads’ Meredith Goldman, director of Amazon DSP. “Integrations like this enable advertisers to build more comprehensive omnichannel strategies that connect brands with consumers throughout their journey across media.”
Lisa Coffey, chief business officer at iHeartMedia, commented, “Making iHeart’s premium audio inventory available through Amazon DSP unlocks scale with deep listener engagement and proven performance. And with accessibility to broadcast radio inventory soon to follow, this partnership is another step in making broadcast radio behave like digital media: addressable, measurable, and available programmatically, so marketers of all sizes can buy with greater ease and consistency.”
Amazon DSP is powered by “trillions” of first-party data points and “advanced clean-room technology,” according to the ecommerce giant. On the video side, Amazon this year has been busy signing up DSP partners, inking recent pacts with Netflix , Disney and Roku for programmatic ad sales .

TV Business Writer
Mobile game company Papaya has set Stephen A. Smith as the official ambassador for the upcoming, first-ever “World Solitaire Championship” (WSC).
The teamup comes on the heels of Smith being spotted playing solitaire on his phone during game 4 of the NBA finals, Oklahoma City vs the Indiana Pacers, in June 2025. Following that viral moment, Smith takes his passion for the game of solitaire one step further by partnering with Papaya for the first-ever World Solitaire Championship, scheduled to take place in Miami this coming February.

Per Papaya, “The World Solitaire Championship is the first-ever global competition for Solitaire, transforming one of the world’s most iconic casual games into a thrilling cultural event. Players from around the world will compete for prizes, recognition, and a weekend experience at Temple House Miami, South Beach’s premier event venue.” Popular on Variety
“When I first heard about the World Solitaire Championship, I was intrigued,” Smith said. “They’re taking a classic game and turning it into something bigger, something that celebrates skill and competition, and that’s something I’m proud to be a part of.”
“When Stephen A. Smith was caught playing Solitaire courtside during the NBA Finals, we knew right away that this was more than a viral moment; it was proof of how timeless and irresistible this game is,” Papaya vice president of marketing Uri Pearl said. “Stephen A. embodies the spirit of the World Solitaire Championship, which is about the Power of Play, competition, culture, and personality. Choosing him as our ambassador felt completely natural.”
As part of the partnership with Smith, Papaya will be launching an AI-driven online campaign to promote the finals led by Ariely Original, a creative lab and advertising agency, in partnership with The Artery, a leading visual effects and creative studio, and Too Short for Modeling as writers and directors.
Smith is repped Envisionary and WME.

The International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) has unveiled its second Focus program for the 55th edition, turning the spotlight on Japan’s V-Cinema — the direct-to-video movement that exploded in the late 1980s and profoundly shaped the country’s contemporary film culture.
The section, curated by Tom Mes, will run as part of the festival’s 2026 edition from Jan. 29 to Feb. 8. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Originating with Toei’s “Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage” (1989), V-Cinema responded to Japan’s booming home video market by producing films that bypassed theaters entirely. The low-budget, high-speed production model gave directors unprecedented creative freedom, birthing a generation of filmmakers who went on to define modern Japanese cinema — including Miike Takashi , Nakata Hideo , Kurosawa Kiyoshi and Aoyama Shinji.
IFFR’s V-Cinema Focus will showcase a range of Toei titles, among them the “Crime Hunter” trilogy — “Crime Hunter: Bullets of Rage,” “Crime Hunter 2: Bullets of Betrayal” and “Crime Hunter 3: Killing Bullet.” The lineup also features Nakata’s debut feature “Female Teacher: Forbidden Sex,” the psychological noir “Betrayal Tomorrow,” and the cult action thriller “XX Beautiful Weapon.” Popular on Variety
The program expands beyond Toei to highlight the anarchic spirit and genre experimentation that defined the movement. Among the selections are the ghostly anthology “Scary True Stories: Second Night,” the eerie found-footage investigation “Psychic Vision: Jaganrei,” and Miike’s hyperviolent “Fudoh: The New Generation.” Other highlights include the surreal gangland fable “Tuff: Part I,” Kurosawa’s deadpan yakuza comedy “Suit Yourself or Shoot Yourself!! VI: The Hero,” Aoyama’s archetypal action drama “A Weapon in My Heart,” and “The King of Minami,” about a loan shark aiding small business owners.
“V-Cinema offered filmmakers the space to take risks, move fast and work with a freedom rarely possible within the traditional studio system,” said IFFR festival director Vanja Kaludjercic. “What emerged was a wild and inventive cinema embracing everything from anarchic yakuza tales and psycho-horror experiments to surreal hybrid pieces — work that still feels electric today.”
IFFR’s full 2026 program will be unveiled on Dec. 16.

“Adam Sandler delivers a deeply moving and career-best performance in Jay Kelly,” said Festival Chairman Nachhattar Singh Chandi in a statement. “It is a performance which underscores his standing as one of the most versatile and respected actors of his generation. We are proud to honor Adam — a singular talent whose work continues to surprise and inspire — with this year’s Chairman’s Award.” Popular on Variety
“Jay Kelly” tells the story of famous movie actor Jay Kelly (Clooney), on a journey of self-discovery where he’s forced to confront both his past and present, accompanied by his devoted manager Ron, played by Sandler. As the two travel through Europe, they begin to reflect on their personal lives, relationships, and their legacies.
Sandler will join previously announced honorees Renate Reinsve, Stellan Skarsgård, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas and Elle Fanning, who will receive this year’s International Star Award during the ceremony for their work in Neon’s “Sentimental Value.”

Senior Editor, Culture and Events
Kathy Hilton insists she’s not involved in any of the drama coming up in Season 15 of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.”
Even so, she warns, “It’s pretty brutal.”
“There’s no Kathy Hilton drama,” she continued. “I’m not really dramatic. All that drama makes me really sad. They’re all just very comfortable in saying whatever they want and that’s what makes it brutal.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
I caught up with the Hilton matriarch Tuesday night at her home in Bel-Air, where she and daughter Nicky were hosting their annual Pajama Party. Presented by QVC, the soiree is a gifting suite of sorts – guests filled personalized Hulken Bags with various free health and beauty products, Oh My Mahjong sets and Slatkin + Co candles, while sipping Moët & Chandon champagne and enjoying “caviar bumps” courtesy of The Caviar Co placed on their top of their hands by the model-worthy waitstaff. Popular on Variety
The event also served as a holiday toy drive as well as a benefit for the Los Angeles Mission, Yogi’s House and Camp Crocker Rescue.
Guests were encouraged – and most obliged – to wear festive pajamas from Hilton’s Printfresh collection.
Earlier Tuesday, the first trailer dropped for the new “RHOBH” season , featuring returning Housewife Denise Richards and newbie cast members stylist Rachel Zoe and businesswoman Amanda France.
Full-time Housewives Erika Jayne, Dorit Kemsley, Kyle Richards, Bozoma St. John and Sutton Stracke are also back. Hilton and Jennifer Tilly welcome a new “friend” in the show, Natalie Swanston Fuller.
“I had a couple of phone calls today from some of the girls [after they saw the trailer], let’s just put it that way,” Hilton said. “Some of them were like, ‘I can’t believe so-and-so did this.’”
Hilton said Zoe, who is also marking her return to Bravo after starring in her own reality show for the cabler, “came in and fit right in. … I don’t think she caused any drama.”
Nicky Hilton teased that she makes an appearance in the season finale: “The event was very dramatic, but me not included,” she said, smiling.
Kathy added, “It was bru-tal!”
Spotted at the party were Frances and Zoe, Jennie Garth, Dylan Mulvaney, screenwriter Sam Lansky, Christine Chiu, Crystal Kung Minkoff, Faye Resnick, Heather Dubrow, Joely Fisher, Nancy Davis, Sutton Stracke, Tommy Hilfiger, Dee Ocleppo, producer Hilary Shor and Maria Bakalova.

Variety Editor at Large
“Therapuss” podcaster and comedian Jake Shane has signed on to executive produce and star in a Hulu half-hour comedy based on his life. The series, in development from 20th TV, stars Shane — playing a version of himself — and “his best friends as they navigate the chaotic new world of online fame, the strain it puts on their friendships, and the tension their presence causes in their suburban neighborhood.”
“Hacks” writer and “High Potential” consulting producer Genevieve Aniello is set to executive produce and write the untitled Jake Shane pilot, while Paul Briganti (“Saturday Night Live”) will direct and executive produce. The pilot is based on an original story by Shane, Aniello and Briganti.

Also attached to executive produce is Alec Berg (“Barry,” “Silicon Valley”) and his producing partner, Amy Solomon, via their overall deal with 20th. Popular on Variety
Shane launched “Therapuss with Jake Shane” in January 2024, and the podcast quickly became one of the top shows on Spotify and among Apple Podcasts’ 20th anniversary list. Most recently, Shane landed the 2025 Webby Award for best comedy creator and was named among Forbes’ 2025 top creators.
The show, now in its second season, has recently included guests such as Tate McRae, Renee Rapp, Glen Powell, Charli XCX, Ben Platt, Ed Sheeran, Joe Jonas, Saweetie, Rosé, FKA Twigs, Katy Perry, Coco Jones, Lisa Rinna, Lea Michele, Lorde and Addison Rae, among others.
“Therapuss” has also led to this year’s North American tour “Live With Jake Shane,” hitting 36 cities — including a Radio City Music Hall stop featuring Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers of the “Las Culturistas” podcast. Shane has also welcomed guests such as The Chainsmokers and Alix Earle at other stops. (Shane also toured in 2024 with “Therapuss Live,” hitting 21 cities.)
After his tour last year, Shane released the 2024 debut comedy album “Puss & Poems,” featuring 13 tracks that he wrote and produced with his pal, record producer Alexander 23. Featuring guests Tate McRae, Jack Schlossberg, Snooki and Joe Jonas, the album hit the top 5 on Billboard’s comedy chart.
Most recently, Shane guest starred this past season on “Hacks” in a recurring role as a social media manager.
Meanwhile, Aniello’s credits include serving as a writer on “Hacks” (which has earned her three WGA awards), consulting producer on “High Potential” and writer/supervising producer on HBO’s upcoming Steve Carell series from Bill Lawrence. She also was a staff writer on “The Other Two” and is working on an hour-long series for Disney+ with Drew Goddard and on a workplace comedy for Fifth Season.
Briganti’s credits include a long-time gig as segment director for “SNL,” working on various shorts. He also directed and exec produced the feature “Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain.”
Berg and Solomon produced “Barry” (which Berg co-created with star Bill Hader) and “Silicon Valley,” which Berg was showrunner. Berg also served as a writer/director/EP on “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and as writer/EP on “Seinfeld.”

Executive Editor, Music
Spotify is raising subscription prices in the U.K. for the second time in 18 months, a rep for the company confirms to Variety, and is also increasing the price of its Premium plans in Switzerland. In the U.K., the price of Spotify’s monthly individual Premium plan will rise to £12.99 from £11.99; it raised that price by a pound in April 2024.
The price of the company’s Spotify’s Duo plan in the U.K. is also rising by a pound, from £16.99 to £17.99 per month, and the Family plans will rise by two pounds, from £19.99 to £21.99 per month. The discounted Student tier apparently will remain at £5.99 per month, according to Music Business Worldwide . Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
“As we continue innovating and enhancing the value we deliver, we periodically update our pricing to reflect local market conditions and economic factors, ensuring our service remains unparalleled,” the company said in a notification to users. Popular on Variety
In Switzerland, the price of an individual subscription increases from 13.95 Swiss Francs to 15.95, or around $20 per month, with increases in other plans similar to the U.K., although the Student tier rises by a Franc.
This move may be paving the way for an inevitable price increase in the U.S. , which last took place in in June 2024 when individual Premium plans went up by $1 per month to $11.99 — an arguably long-overdue increase, since streaming provides enormous value for consumers but considerably less for musicians and especially songwriters.
In a move that met with widespread criticism, last year Spotify reduced its royalty payments to musicians and songwriters by hundreds of millions of dollars per year by automatically imposing a bundling plan with its audiobooks division that few music fans would seem likely to want.
Multiple analysts, from Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan and beyond, have said that a U.S. price increase is likely by next year at the latest. J.P. Morgan has estimated that such an increase in the U.S. would increase Spotify’s annual revenue by around $493 million — nearly half a billion dollars.
It seems likely that such a move would be accompanied by an update in the company’s service, perhaps the much-discussed “Superfan” tier that would provide access to more music and other assets (presumably merch exclusives and the like).
Variety will have more on the situation as it develops.

Netflix ‘s shares are about to become more affordable.
The streaming giant announced Thursday that its board approved a 10-for-1 forward stock split of Netflix common stock. “The purpose of the stock split is to reset the market price of the Company’s common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the Company’s stock option program,” Netflix said in announcing the plan.

Netflix stock closed at $1,089.00 per share Thursday, down about 1% on the day but up nearly 23% year to date. On the announcement of the 10-for-1 split, shares rose more than 3% in after-hours trading. Popular on Variety
Each Netflix shareholder of record as of the close of trading on Monday, Nov. 10, 2025, will receive, after the close of trading on Friday, Nov. 14, 2025, nine additional shares for every share held on the record date. Trading is expected to begin on a split-adjusted basis at market open on Monday, Nov. 17, 2025.
Netflix said the split will be effected through an amendment to the company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The company most recently enacted a seven-for-one stock split that took effect July 14, 2015 .
For the third quarter of 2025, Netflix revenue climbed 17% to $11.51 billion, in-line with forecasts, but its earnings per share missed Wall Street expectations due to one-time $619 million charge related to a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities .

“We wanted to start where it all began, with the original campaign that defined Halo,” executive producer Damon Conn said in an Xbox Wire post Friday. “Starting here means people that have never played the game before will be able to understand the story from the very beginning, and that can help us chart a course forward with new Halo stories. Focusing on the campaign experience means we can concentrate fully on really capturing the atmosphere, tone – the emotional impact of what made the first campaign so special and iconic.”
“Halo: Campaign Evolved” is coming in 2026 to Xbox Series X and S, Xbox on PC, Steam, PlayStation 5. The game will support Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Play Anywhere and be available at launch with Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.

The deal kicks off with “Sundown,” a supernatural thriller film written, directed and starring Kinigra Deon. The story follows a group of Black college friends who take a wrong turn into a racially hostile town where local myths turn terrifyingly real.

Two additional films will be announced at a later date. Popular on Variety
The partnership was brokered by Jeff Clanagan, president and chief distribution officer of Hartbeat, and Sam Harowitz, Tubi’s SVP of content acquisitions and partnerships.

Clanagan said: “Hartbeat has always been about championing the creators who shape culture and move audiences.

Taipei-Los Angeles-based production house Organic Media Group has set a Chinese-language remake of hit French comedy series “ Call My Agent !,” the company revealed at the Taiwan Creative Content Fest ( TCCF ).
The remake will center on a top Asian talent agency, where a team of savvy and stressed-out agents juggle superstar clients, personal chaos, and industry politics. The original series has spawned international adaptations in some 12 countries.

OMG is targeting the global Chinese-speaking diaspora while rooting the production in Taiwan’s entertainment ecosystem. Despite a local Taiwanese series that covered similar territory, OMG co-founder and CEO Steve Chicorel sees opportunity rather than obstacle. Popular on Variety
“Yes, our version will be a remake of the hit series, yet we’re adding organic nuances — making it local for Taiwanese, yet international, inviting superstars from Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Asian-Americans, and yes, even China to join the cast — for worldwide distribution, not just Taiwan,” Chicorel said.
Award-winning French producer Natacha Devillers, whose credits include “Moon the Panda” for Gaumont and Disney, has been attached for several years developing the adaptation in collaboration with Taiwanese director Wu Zhongtian and writer Yang Jingxiang. The production is currently seeking financing and is prepared to move into pre-production pending co-financing commitments.
OMG also unveiled three other series in development, all to be shot in Taiwan. “Detective Daji” is a supernatural detective series featuring Taiwanese actress Puff Kuo about a murdered detective resurrected by an ancient Fox Demon. It won best series pitch from Mediacorp at the Asian Television Forum last year.
“Undertaker” follows a down-on-his-luck misfit who finds meaning working at a Taiwanese funeral home. The series is near completion and produced by Sarso Chou, who previously won best miniseries or television film at the Golden Bell Awards for “On Children.”
“Expats: Taiwan — A Day in the Life” is an unscripted series built for both Western and Asian audiences exploring why expatriates love Taiwan and their contributions beyond teaching English. Future seasons will shift to Thailand, Japan, and Korea.
OMG has arranged U.S. distribution for all four projects with Golden TV, a new all-Asian channel serving 20 million cable homes through its 24/7 cable network ChimeTV via Charter Spectrum, as well as streaming and FAST channels.
Co-founded by “Bling Empire” star Kelly Mi Li and Chicorel in 2019, Organic Media Group specializes in cross-market IP, talent, and distribution strategies connecting Asian and U.S. platforms, with offices in Taipei and Los Angeles.

During a recent appearance on the “ Hate to Break It to Ya ” podcast, Raven-Symoné says she separates Bill Cosby ‘s impact on the TV industry from his “horrific” sexual assault allegations.
“Separate the creator from the creation,” she said. “And that’s just where I live. The creation changed America. Changed television.”
“He’s also been accused of some horrific things,” Symoné added. “That does not excuse, but that’s his personal [life]. So personally, keep that there, and then business-wise, know what he did there as well. Like you said, both can live, and I think our culture is right to…don’t do wrong. Don’t do wrong personally. You just can’t do wrong.” Popular on Variety Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Symoné appeared as Olivia Kendall alongside Cosby on “The Cosby Show” from 1989 until the show’s end in 1992. Cosby co-created the show in 1984 and starred as Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable. “The Cosby Show” earned six Emmy awards and ran for 197 episodes.
Cosby first faced sexual assault allegations back in 2004 from Andrea Constand, but it wasn’t until 2014 that the accusations became widely known. In 2014, Barbara Bowman, who testified in support of Constand’s civil suit against Cosby, penned an op-ed for The Washington Post titled, “Bill Cosby raped me. Why did it take 30 years for people to believe my story?”
In the years following, dozens more women came forward with their own allegations against Cosby. In 2016, he was ordered to stand trial by the Montgomery County Magisterial District Court for sexual assault. The trial began in June 2017 and ended in a mistrial after twelve days.
Cosby was eventually convicted in a 2018 retrial on three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault and sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overturned the conviction in 2021 due to a previous agreement Cosby had with Montgomery County prosecutor Bruce Castor. The pair agreed Cosby could not be prosecuted if he provided a deposition in Constand’s civil case.

The shock news — which would fundamentally change the British broadcasting landscape if it were to go ahead — would see Comcast take control of ITV’s linear channels and ITVX streaming business, significantly expanding its U.K. TV foothold, having already acquired Sky for around $30 billion in 2018. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
According to news reports, the bid from Sky centers on the potential creation of a U.K.-focused streaming giant. Popular on Variety
In a short statement sent Friday morning, ITV said it noted “the recent press speculation and confirms that it is in preliminary discussions regarding a possible sale of its M&E business to Sky for an enterprise value of £1.6bn.”
It added: “There can be no certainty as to the terms upon which any potential sale may be agreed or whether any transaction will take place. A further announcement will be made in due course if appropriate.”
The discussions do not include ITV’s production and sales arm, ITV Studios, which makes shows including “Love Island,” “I’m a Celebrity” and the drama “Mr Bates vs The Post Office” and has been the center of numerous recent takeover rumors. RedBird IMI and Banijay are understood to have expressed an interest in the unit.
Despite only being preliminary, the idea of a sale of ITV’s TV business to Sky — which would require regulatory approval — has sent the U.K. broadcasting world into a spin.
“ITV’s proposed £1.6 billion sale of its Media & Entertainment division to Sky could mark a turning point for British television,” said Giao Pacey, partner and corporate lawyer at media and entertainment law firm Simkins LLP. “It’s not just a divestment, it’s a sign that U.K. broadcasters are rethinking how they operate in a fast-moving media landscape. By offloading its traditional TV channels and streaming service ITVX, ITV is aiming to reduce its reliance on advertising, which can be unpredictable, and instead focus on producing content it can sell globally.”
Confirmation of the deal talks came shortly after ITV reported that it would “temporarily” shave $46 million from its budgets over the U.K.’s “softening economy” and advertiser uncertainty. It said it expected ad revenues to fall by 9% in the key fourth-quarter period in the lead up to Christmas.
ITV shares jumped 18% at the start of trading in London on Friday following news of a potential deal with Sky.

Senior Editor, Culture and Events
The Duffer brothers , Matt and Ross, call the upcoming theatrical release of “Stranger Things” is “dream” come true.
As previously reported, the two-hour series finale of the series – the last episode titled “The Rightside Up” — will premiere on Netflix and in more than 350 movie theaters on Dec. 31, starting at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET, playing through Jan. 1. This marks the first time an episode of a Netflix series will also be exhibited theatrically.

“This has been a dream of ours for a while,” Ross told me Thursday night at the world premiere of the series’ fifth and final season at the TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood.
Netflix announced the plans just days after Variety published an interview with Netflix’s chief content officer Bela Bajaria in which she insisted the streamer had no plans to release “ Stranger Things ” in theaters. “A lot of people — a lot, a lot, a lot of people — have watched ‘Stranger Things’ on Netflix,” she said. “It has not suffered from lack of conversation or community or sharing or fandom. I think releasing it on Netflix is giving the fans what they want.”
Praising Bajaria for her “poker face,” Matt said, “Ross and I just folded. The truth is…this was in the works for a long time. Netflix came to us with the idea. It was their idea to have the finale on a separate day and we thought that was cool, specifically because we thought we could pitch this movie theater idea, which we had never pitched before, honestly.”
He continued, “It never really made sense to us because everyone will always ask about it. I’m like, ‘Well, it’s kind of not fun because no one’s in sync. People will have seen the episode, some people won’t have seen the episode, it’s not the same. This actually recreates and is a real movie moment because everyone’s experiencing it at the same time together. I think that’s what we’re excited about it and it’s the first time we had that opportunity.”
Star Millie Bobby Brown explained that she wore a black custom Rodarte gown to the premiere as an homage to the end of the series. “It’s for the funeral of the show,” she said. “This dress kind of embodies the darkness of the show this season. I’m really excited for everyone to see how dark it gets. I hate to say it because I say it every season, but this is definitely the darkest and the more intense season.”

Senior Awards Editor
Will “ Stranger Things ” conquer more than the Upside Down?
Netflix has revealed its awards strategy for the fifth and final season of “Stranger Things,” submitting the entire acting ensemble cast in supporting categories for the Golden Globes in addition to other fall awards, Variety has learned exclusively.
The Golden Globes slate features all performers submitted for best performance by an actor/actress in a supporting role on television in their respective gender categories. The series itself is listed once again for best television series (drama), while the ensemble will compete for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series at the SAG Awards and the show’s stunt team will also be submitted. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
These submissions apply only to the fall awards season. Netflix’s official Emmy campaign strategy for 2026 has yet to be determined. For the Golden Globes specifically, voters will consider only the first four episodes of the final season. Popular on Variety
For the SAG Awards, which notably does not distinguish between lead and supporting performers in television series, all actors compete in the same race: David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp and Jamie Campbell Bower are positioned for outstanding performance by a male actor in a drama series, while Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer and Maya Hawke compete for the female equivalent.
The news of the submissions follow the show’s highly successful world premiere Thursday evening at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, held on Stranger Things Day (Nov. 6). The event screened the season opener “The Crawl” along with 10 minutes from the second episode, edited together seamlessly, giving audiences their first glimpse at the series’ epic conclusion.
Netflix’s all-supporting strategy for the Globes is a notable departure from traditional awards positioning, where series typically designate clear lead performers. Ryder was submitted in the lead category the previous two seasons. The decision emphasizes the show’s ensemble nature and could prove advantageous in a competitive fall season.
The move also sparks speculation about whether “Stranger Things” could achieve a capstone moment in the TV awards space, similar to other beloved franchises that peaked in their final outings. “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” famously swept the Oscars with 11 wins, while recent television juggernauts “Schitt’s Creek” and “Game of Thrones” dominated their final Emmy cycles.
“Stranger Things” enters its farewell season with a formidable awards pedigree: 57 Primetime Emmy nominations (12 wins), four Golden Globe nominations and a 2017 SAG Award win for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. The cast has been collectively nominated three times in that category. Brown stands as the most nominated cast member overall, while she, Harbour and Ryder have each received individual SAG recognition. Brown and Harbour have earned two Emmy noms each, with Harbour and Ryder also garnering Golden Globe nods.
The fifth season will roll out across three volumes: four episodes on Nov. 26, three on Christmas Day and the series finale on New Year’s Eve, with each release scheduled for 5 p.m. PST. The staggered release strategy ensures “Stranger Things” maintains cultural dominance throughout the holiday season, potentially building momentum for Emmy campaigns.

Sources tell Variety that Mike Weiss, the current showrunner of “FBI,” is in talks to take over while also continuing to showrun and executive produce “FBI.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Production will be pausing on “CIA” briefly during the showrunner transition, but it is not anticipated that the changes will impact the premiere date, currently set for mid-season. Popular on Variety
The one-hour crime drama is led by Tom Ellis and “Chicago Med” alum Nick Gehlfuss , who play “two unlikely partners – a fast-talking, rule-breaking loose cannon CIA case officer (Ellis), and a by-the-book, seasoned and smart FBI agent (Gehlfuss) who believes in the rule of law.”
Per the official logline, “When this odd couple are assigned to work out of CIA’s New York Station, they must learn to work together to investigate cases and criminals posing threats on U.S. soil, finding that their differences may actually be their strength.”
Natalee Linez also stars in the drama, and casting is underway for a new chief of station, a role previously played by Michael Michele. Michele recently exited the show.
“CIA” and “FBI” are from Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, in association with Wolf Entertainment.

Tisca Chopra’s directorial debut feature “ Saali Mohabbat ” is set to premiere on Indian streaming platform ZEE5 later this year, following festival runs at IFFI Goa and the Chicago South Asian Film Festival.
The film centers on Smita, a small-town housewife whose seemingly ordinary life unravels into a narrative exploring infidelity, deceit and moral ambiguity.
The thriller-drama stars Radhika Apte , Divyenndu Sharma, Anurag Kashyap, Anshumaan Pushkar, Sauraseni Maitra and Sharat Saxena. The film marks a reunion for Apte with ZEE5 after her previous platform appearance in “Mrs. Undercover.” Popular on Variety Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
“Saali Mohabbat” is produced by Jio Studios and Manish Malhotra ‘s Stage5 Production, marking the celebrated fashion designer’s digital debut as a producer. The project represents ZEE5’s fourth collaboration with Jio Studios, following “Hisaab Barabar” and “Mrs.,” which starred R. Madhavan and Sanya Malhotra, respectively, as well as “Bhagwat” featuring Arshad Warsi and Jitendra Kumar.
“I’ve always been fascinated by the quiet tensions that exist beneath the surface of relationships — the invisible power struggles, the unspoken expectations, the ways in which love can transform into something darker,” Chopra said. “This film explores those fragile boundaries — of trust, betrayal, and identity — but through a deeply female perspective.”
Kaveri Das, business head of Hindi ZEE5, added: “With ‘Saali Mohabbat,’ we’re thrilled to present a thriller that’s not just about suspense, but about the intricate emotions that drive human choices.”
Jyoti Deshpande, president of Jio Studios, characterized the film as “an ingeniously crafted thriller that marks our proud collaboration with producer Manish Malhotra, who seamlessly extends his creative brilliance from fashion to film.”
Malhotra explained that Stage5 Production was established to support original stories with strong craft. “This project has been built with deep involvement at every stage — from development to the final cut — because at Stage5, we don’t just produce films, we stand by them,” he said. “Every creative and strategic decision has been shaped with purpose, rigour, and responsibility.”
The producer noted the film features “an ensemble of exceptionally talented actors, each bringing a distinct rhythm, restraint, and truth to their characters — the kind of performances that don’t speak loudly but linger.”
Chopra credited Malhotra with providing crucial early support for the project. “Manish’s response — just three minutes into the narration — gave me the conviction that this story had found its right home,” she said. “He and his team supported the film not just with resources, but with genuine artistic trust and emotional understanding, allowing it to retain its raw, unpolished honesty.”
The director described the filmmaking experience as “both terrifying and liberating — terrifying because it demanded emotional vulnerability, and liberating because it allowed me to step outside the boundaries women filmmakers are so often placed within.”
ZEE5 serves 190-plus countries with a language-first platform approach, delivering content in seven languages: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Malayalam, Kannada and Marathi.

Ego Nwodim is sharing her feelings about her time on “ Saturday Night Live ” and her decision to leave the late-night series just before its 51st season.
On Wednesday’s episode of “Sherri,” Sherri Shepherd pointed out that there are no longer any Blasck women in the “ SNL ” cast asked Nwodim if she felt “the weight of all of that representation” during her time on the show.
“I don’t know that I would call it weight. I felt honored to be the seventh Black woman in that cast,” Nwodim replied. “I hope that there will be more Black women. Punkie Johnson came on the show after me. Who knows who else they’ll find as they explore and seek out other talents?” (Johnson the cast in 2020 and departed in 2024, a year before Nwodim’s exit.)

Speaking about her exit, she said, “It’s like being in a marriage. I’ve never done it before, but that show was my longest relationship ever. I’m not a commitment-phobe, but I heard when you’re married, you get the seven-year itch. And it’s like, I wanna date other people! I wanna see some other privates!”
“It felt like the time to make space for something else for me,” Nwodim added.

Adam Friedland has signed with UTA.
The comedian and podcaster best known for hosting “The Adam Friedland Show” will be represented by the agency in all areas, including film, television, news media, podcasting and comedy touring.
Friedland rose from the crude, cult-hit comedy podcast “Cum Town” before launching his freewheeling, offbeat comedy talk program “The Adam Friedland Show,” which, complete with a cozy set reminiscent of the 1970s, is loosely inspired by “The Dick Cavett Show.” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)

Richie Torres have garnered viral fame and led GQ magazine to crown him “the millennial Jon Stewart” in a profile earlier this year. “The Adam Friedland Show” is currently in its second season, with recent guests including Chance the Rapper, Sen. Chris Murphy, Richard Kind, Amanda Knox, Logic, Blake Griffin and Rainn Wilson. Popular on Variety

He joins a wide comedy roster at UTA that includes Sebastian Maniscalco, Nate Bargatze, Nikki Glaser, Bo Burnham, Demetri Martin, Nathan Fielder, Sarah Sherman and more.

Nearly half of Gen Z say that YouTube or social video platforms are their preferred entertainment platforms over traditional TV or paid streaming.
According to Activate Consulting’s Technology & Media Outlook 2026 , which was unveiled by CEO Michael Wolf at the WSJ Tech Live event on Wednesday, 43% of Gen Z are opting for YouTube and TikTok for their media and news consumption.
Per the same survey, the popularity of “ microdramas ” — one of the latest trends on those platforms, consisting of 1-2 minute scripted episodes of an ongoing storyline — has been increasing at a fast rate with 28 million U.S. adults (52% aged 18-34) reportedly watching that new form of content.

Additional findings include projections for global internet and media revenue to increase by $388 billion by 2029, while average daily time spent streaming video will climb to 4 hours and 8 minutes as time spent watching traditional TV is set to collapse to just 1 hour and 17 minutes.
Activate estimates that, as a result, streaming revenues (from ads and subscriptions) will grow 18-19% annually while traditional TV revenues will fall 4-6% year to year.
According to the consulting firm’s report, people are currently living a “32-hour, 17-minute day” by multitasking throughout their daily routine online, and consumers spend over 13 hours on media daily by utilizing various social media platforms like Instagram, X, and TikTok. To capitalize on this trend, companies like Amazon are moving into creating more video content, alongside streaming services like Spotify moving to creating audiobooks.

YouTube’s subscriptions business includes more than 125 million YouTube Music and Premium customers , while YouTube TV is estimated to have more than 10 million subscribers, making it the top U.S. internet pay-TV service.
Oestlien, in a statement provided to Variety , said: “We have an incredible opportunity across music, podcasts, media, sports and TV. Bringing these successful businesses together, alongside the ads-supported products that super-serve our users, will enable us to move even faster, learn from each other’s successes, and scale resources. It’s a privilege to lead this team, and I believe that together we can create a unified vision that delivers even more value to our users and partners.”
Oestlien joined YouTube in 2015 from Twitter, where he had been VP of product management. Prior to that, he spent seven years at Google in different product management roles, and earlier worked in product management at Yahoo.

The Viewer Products team will focus on the viewer experience, encompassing the YouTube main app, living room, search and discovery, YouTube Kids, learning, infrastructure, and trust and safety.
In addition, YouTube is creating a third separate product organization, called Creator & Community Products. This group will focus on supporting creators of all sizes, driving creation through generative AI tools, YouTube Shorts and YouTube Live, and building community across the platform. Currently YouTube has separate leads for Creator Products (Amjad Hanif) and Emerging Experiences & Community Products (Toni Reid); those teams will be merged into one organization and YouTube is in the process of hiring a new lead for the combined team who will report to Mohan.

After exiting “Saturday Night Live,” Ego Nwodim is keeping plenty busy — including with the second season of her award-winning interview podcast “Thanks Dad,” set to premiere next week.
“Thanks Dad With Ego Nwodim” has joined iHeartMedia and Will Ferrell’s Big Money Players Network, which features a slate of comedy podcasts. Season 2 debuts Tuesday, Oct. 28. “Thanks Dad With Ego Nwodim” will feature weekly episodes released on Tuesdays, available on the iHeartRadio app and all major podcast platforms.

In each episode, Ego invites a special guest to dive into personal stories, family dynamics and identity. In the premiere episode of season two, Nwodim will sit down with Heidi Gardner — who also recently left the cast of “SNL” — to discuss becoming best friends at “Saturday Night Live,” as well as Gardner’s mom’s wacky ex-boyfriends, their love of Jack Black and … FaceTiming naked in the shower. Other guests in the upcoming season include Tamron Hall and Miguel. Popular on Variety
In her convo with Gardner, Nwodim recalls that the two shared a dressing room on “SNL” during Nwodim’s first year on the show. “It made us close quick, but it doesn’t have to work that way,” Nwodim says. “It could also not make you close… but I’m so grateful we got so close and we got to share that year. Because I wonder if we would have been as close as we are if we didn’t have that.” Says Gardner, “We would have figured it out.”
Nwodim’s “Thanks Dad” was previously produced and distributed by comedy podcast network Headgum. (Earlier this month, Headgum laid off about 30% of its employees .) Season 1 of her podcast featured guests including Andy Cohen, Randall Park, Kyle Mooney and Bill Burr and received a 2025 Ambie Award for best interview podcast.
“I’m so thrilled to be partnering with iHeartPodcasts, Will Ferrell and Big Money Players for Season 2 of ‘Thanks Dad’!” Nwodim said. “This season, I’m speaking with a broader range of guests, while staying true to the heart of the podcast — to connect, inspire and bring some joy.”
Following the announcement last month of her departure from “SNL” after seven seasons, Nwodim said that the venerated NBC show “is always meant to be a stepping stone. There’s so many ideas that I need to have time to create. I’m looking forward to doing that. So directing, more writing in a different capacity.”
In addition to “Thanks Dad,” Nwodim is making her off-Broadway debut this fall with a one-woman comedy show at Lincoln Center. During her tenure on “Saturday Night Live,” the actress and comedian created viral moments including “Miss Eggy” and “Lisa From Temecula,” establishing herself as a groundbreaking voice in comedy and earning NAACP Image Awards nominations in both 2024 and 2025 for her work on the show. She recently wrapped production on Matt Spicer’s “Little Brother,” the upcoming Netflix comedy film opposite John Cena, Eric Andre Michelle Monaghan, Christopher Meloni, Ego Nwodim and Sherry Cola..
In 2021, Nwodim was recognized by Variety as part of the New York Women’s Impact Report for her trailblazing work across comedy, TV and media.
Founded by Ferrell (who is also a veteran of “SNL”) and iHeartMedia, Big Money Players Network shows include “The Ron Burgundy Podcast,” “Las Culturistas With Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang,” “My Momma Told Me,” “Straightiolab With George Civeris and Sam Taggart,” “Bombing with Eric Andre” and “MESS With Sydnee Washington and Marie Faustin.” All BMP podcasts are executive produced by Ferrell and iHeartMedia and distributed by iHeartPodcasts.

NY Digital Editor
You’ve got… a new owner!
AOL , the trailblazing internet company, is being acquired by Italian tech roll-up company Bending Spoons . Bending Spoons is buying AOL from private-equity firm Apollo Global Management , which in 2021 bought Yahoo (inclusive of the AOL brand) from Verizon for $5 billion. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Deal terms weren’t disclosed. Bending Spoons is buying AOL for about $1.5 billion, Axios reported . AOL generates around $400 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) with revenue of more than $500 million, according to a Wall Street Journal report . Popular on Variety
AOL currently has about 8 million daily active users and 30 million monthly active users for its news, content and games web portal and email services, according to Bending Spoons. An early leader in internet connectivity, AOL officially shuttered its dial-up internet business on Sept. 30.
Last month, Bending Spoons announced a deal to acquire video-hosting provider Vimeo for $1.38 billion in cash . That deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to approvals.
“AOL is an iconic, beloved business that’s in good health, has stood the test of time, and we believe has unexpressed potential,” said Bending Spoons CEO and co-founder Luca Ferrari in a statement. “We intend to invest significantly to help the product and the business flourish. Bending Spoons has never sold an acquired business — we’re confident we’re the right long-term steward for AOL, and look forward to serving its large, loyal customer base for many years to come.”
AOL was founded in 1985 as Quantum Computer Services before being renamed America Online in 1989 (and then AOL in 2006). In the high-flying dot-com days, AOL also engineered what is widely considered among the worst mega-mergers ever with its deal for Time Warner to create AOL Time Warner, completed in January 2001, which was valued at a staggering $350 billion at the time . That merger was unwound in 2009.
Jim Lanzone, CEO of Yahoo Inc., said, “AOL and Yahoo share a great deal of history, and our new team has enjoyed the opportunity to return AOL to growth. This transaction will allow us to focus more deeply on the aggressive roadmaps we have planned for Yahoo’s core products moving forward, while ensuring AOL continues to thrive under new ownership.”
Reed Rayman, chair of Yahoo’s board and partner at Apollo, said, “Since Apollo Funds acquired Yahoo in 2021, we’ve helped the company drive transformational reinvestment in its digital media assets and consumer technology, producing strong performance across Yahoo’s properties. We believe this transaction positions AOL well for its next phase, while Yahoo accelerates investment in its flagship properties and AI-powered experiences.”
To finance the acquisition of AOL — as well as future M&A deals — Bending Spoons also announced the completion of a $2.8 billion debt financing package from banks including BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, J.P. Morgan, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole CIB and Wells Fargo.
Bending Spoons’ other digital businesses include Brightcove, Evernote, komoot, Meetup, Remini, StreamYard and WeTransfer. The company, based in Milan, Italy, claims its products have more than 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers.

TV Reporter
Sarah Paulson is reuniting with Ryan Murphy, this time in “ Monster .”
Variety has learned from sources that Paulson is nearing a deal to appear in the upcoming fourth season of Murphy and Ian Brennan’s Netflix anthology series, in which she would play notorious serial killer Aileen Wuornos. As previously reported, Season 4 will focus on Lizzie Borden and the axe murder of her father and stepmother. Production is now underway in Los Angeles. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Given that Wuornos is not the focus of the season, it stands to reason that Season 4 will examine Borden’s impact on the perception of and connection to other female killers, much like how Season 3 explored the impact of Ed Gein’s crimes on popular culture. Popular on Variety
Reps for Netflix declined to comment.
Ella Beatty will star as Lizzie, while Charlie Hunnam — who just played Gein in “Monster” Season 3 — will play her father, Andrew Jackson Borden. In addition, Rebecca Hall will star as Lizzie’s stepmother, Abby, with Billie Lourd as Lizzie’s sister, Emma Borden. Jessica Barden will play the actress Nance O’Neill, who was Lizzie’s friend, and Vicky Krieps will star the Borden family’s maid, Bridget Sullivan.
Wuornos was convicted of the murder of seven men in Florida, where she was ultimately executed in 2002. She has been the subject of numerous documentaries and books since then, with Charlize Theron winning the Academy Award for best actress for playing Wuornos in the 2003 film “Monster.” Other actresses who have portrayed Wuornos onscreen include Peyton List, Jean Smart, and Lily Rabe. Rabe played Wuornos in the fifth season of “American Horror Story,” another Murphy production.
This marks the latest collaboration between Paulson and Murphy. Paulson has famously appeared in nearly every season of “American Horror Story,” for which she has received five Emmy nominations. It was announced just last week that Paulson will return to the franchise for its upcoming 13th season.
She also starred in both “The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story” and “Impeachment: American Crime Story,” on which Murphy is an executive producer and director. Paulson won the Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a limited series for “People v. OJ.” Additional collaborations include the Netflix series “Ratched,” the first season of “Feud,” and the Hulu legal drama “All’s Fair.”
Outside of the Murphy-verse, Paulson is known for roles in shows like “Mrs. America” and “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip” as well as films like “12 Years a Slave,” “Glass,” and “Ocean’s 8.” She is also an accomplished stage actress, with Paulson winning the Tony and Drama Desk Award for best actress in a play for “Appropriate.”
She is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, Hansen Jacobson, and Birch Public Relations.

By Todd Spangler
NY Digital Editor
Disney’s ESPN has changed up its gambling partners and go-to-market betting strategy.
ESPN and DraftKings clinched a major new agreement that makes DraftKings the exclusive “official sportsbook and odds provider of ESPN,” effective Dec. 1, 2025. Also Thursday, ESPN announced the end of its deal with Penn Entertainment under which the companies “mutually agreed” to the early termination of their exclusive U.S. online sports betting agreement on Dec. 1 after two years. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
ESPN Bet , which has been powered by Penn, will shift to a sports-betting content brand with DraftKings Sportsbook integrations, anchored by ESPN’s betting show, “ESPN BET Live,” which currently airs weekdays at 6:30 p.m. ET on ESPN2, and dedicated social and digital channels. Popular on Variety
Leading up to and following the Dec. 1 termination date of its deal with Penn, ESPN will work with the gambling operator “to facilitate a transition” for users from ESPN Bet to Penn’s theScore Bet.
Beginning next month, DraftKings entertainment products will start to be exclusively integrated across ESPN’s platforms with a full rollout expected in 2026. At launch, ESPN users will have access to betting features and offerings including DraftKings’ sportsbook, daily fantasy and DraftKings Pick6.
ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said, “Our betting approach has focused on offering an integrated experience within our products. Working with DraftKings, a leader in the space, will allow us to build upon that foundation, continue to super-serve passionate sports fans and grow our ESPN direct-to-consumer business. We are excited about this new collaboration with DraftKings.”
DraftKings also will play a major role across ESPN’s digital platforms: DraftKings will power the betting tab within the ESPN app and DraftKings customers will receive special promotions for ESPN Unlimited, the recently launched direct-to-consumer product.
DraftKings operates online wagering in 28 states and Washington, D.C., and Ontario, Canada, with more than 10 million customers across its products. The deal with ESPN “expands ESPN’s ability to be the go-to platform for sports fans with access to DraftKings’ products,” the companies said.
“ESPN’s unmatched visibility across the world of sports make this collaboration a natural fit,” said Jason Robins, CEO and co-founder of DraftKings. “As an innovative leader in digital sports entertainment, DraftKings is uniquely positioned to integrate our technology and products with ESPN’s iconic brand and storytelling power. Together, we’re delivering a seamless, engaging and responsible experience that elevates how fans connect with live sports.”
Meanwhile, with the wind-down of ESPN’s pact with Penn — announced in August 2023 with a 10-year term — all outstanding payments to ESPN from Penn Entertainment will cease in the fourth quarter of 2025. Penn will continue to be an ESPN advertising client.
“Together, ESPN and PENN created a truly unique offering with unparalleled integrations across our various media assets,” said Pitaro. ESPN drove more than 2.9 million new users to Penn’s services, he said, “with a strong uptick in first time bettors this fall. We appreciate the collaboration we had with Penn and are now pursuing other media and marketing opportunities within this space.”
Under the terms of the original commercial agreement, ESPN agreed to provide Penn with media, marketing services and the exclusive right to the ESPN Bet trademark for online betting in the U.S. in exchange for $150 million per year in cash payments to ESPN and warrants to purchase common stock of Penn. The agreement had an initial term of 10 years, with the right for either party to terminate the agreement after the third year if “specific market share performance thresholds” were not met.
Jay Snowden, president and CEO of Penn Entertainment, said the company plans to refocus its digital strategy on its iCasino business, “while continuing to capitalize on our omnichannel advantage as the nation’s leading regional retail casino operator.” Snowden said Penn plans to rebrand its online betting service in the U.S. as theScore Bet with a target date of Dec. 1, to coincide with the expected launch of sports betting in Missouri, subject to regulatory approvals. Penn currently operates theScore Bet brand in Ontario, Canada; theScore media app has approximately 4 million monthly active users across North America.

By Clayton Davis
Senior Awards Editor
Nina Hoss enters a conversation about “ Hedda ” the way her character Eileen Lövborg enters that fateful party: She commands the space, is unapologetically present and utterly impossible to overlook.
The German actress, who spent six years performing “Hedda Gabler” on stage in Berlin’s demanding repertoire system, now takes on Nia DaCosta’s bold reimagining of the Ibsen classic — playing a character that didn’t exist in the original text. It’s a transformation that reflects Hoss’s artistic fearlessness and the kind of creative risks that make century-old material feel urgent again. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
“When I read the script, I thought, why has no one ever thought about that?” Hoss tells Variety ‘s Awards Circuit Podcast of DaCosta’s decision to gender-swap the male character Eilert Lövborg into Eileen. “It makes it so interesting for the other female characters. All of a sudden it becomes this triangle of three very, in their own right, complicated, nuanced, colorful female characters. And that wasn’t in the play.” Popular on Variety
For Hoss, the lasting appeal of “Hedda,” both on stage and now on screen, lies in its exploration of internal conflict and social paralysis. “What is it that we, being male or female, don’t allow ourselves to do? To live the life we really want, to follow the desires or passions we feel inside?” she asks. “We think we can’t do it because society expects something of us, or because we feel we’re queer, and we think, no, I can’t live that life. That is what I find so interesting, and always fascinating.”
In DaCosta’s version, Eileen is no longer a boozy male intellectual but a woman fighting to be taken seriously — as a writer, an academic and a person. “Her struggle to enter the academic world, to be respected as a writer, as a person — even as an openly queer person — became so much more front-facing and deep,” Hoss explains. The gender reversal reshapes not only Eileen but the entire narrative architecture.
Variety Awards Circuit: Oscars
Oscar buzz is building for Hoss’s fierce, emotionally expansive performance, with many industry observers positioning her as a formidable contender for best supporting actress — what would be her first Academy Award nomination. The recognition feels long overdue for an actress who has delivered consistently extraordinary work across two decades, yet was overlooked for her haunting turns in “Barbara” (2012), “Phoenix” (2015) and most recently as the calculating partner to an enigmatic musician in “Tár” (2022). Her work in “Hedda” showcases the full range of her gifts. If the Academy is finally ready to embrace one of international cinema’s most compelling actors, this could be her moment.
Working with DaCosta — who joins Todd Field and Christian Petzold in the roster of visionary directors Hoss has collaborated with — was another transformative experience. “What they all have in common is that, at the end of the day, they’re deeply curious about what we bring to the table as actors,” she says. “They have this kind of childlike curiosity — ‘What are you going to do with it?’ And that’s the best, because you feel so trusted.”
For Hoss, who describes herself as “very much an interpreter” rather than a producer or director, that trust is essential. Splitting her time between German theater and international films, she approaches each role with a careful mix of instinct and collaboration. “I’ve done theater. I always go back home and do German films, because I find having that base important,” she says. “I don’t belong to anyone. I’m open to the right material and the collaborators who are fascinating to me.”
In “Hedda,” Hoss embodies a woman who refuses to shrink herself. Her costume — a custom-made dress with a corset and voluminous skirt — reflects a character who, while recovering from addiction, walks boldly into a space designed to undo her. “She’s unapologetically female,” Hoss says. “She walks into a room full of men in suits and says, ‘Here I am.’ She’s not hiding. She’s not seductive in the conventional sense — she just is.”
“There’s something weirdly joyous about Hedda,” Hoss adds, speaking of a character defined by entrapment. Perhaps that’s because she recognizes the universal truth beneath the period costumes and theatrical origins: we are all, in some way, “these weird creatures that have a free will, but we’re kind of stuck inside ourselves.” In DaCosta’s pressure-cooker reimagining, that suffocation becomes not just visible but visceral — and through Hoss’s performance, unexpectedly, powerfully alive.
On this episode of the Variety Awards Circuit Podcast, she discusses her role in DaCosta’s film, reflects on a changing Hollywood and what we can expect from her future roles. Listen below!
Read excerpts from his interview below, which has been edited and condensed for clarity.
You played Hedda Gabler on stage for six years. What was that experience like, and how did it prepare you for this film?
Just to explain — that’s possible because of the repertoire system we have in Germany. I might perform “Hedda Gabler” six times a month, or sometimes just twice, depending on what else is running. One night might be “Medea,” the next “Hedda.” At one point, I had six plays in rotation at the same time. So you’re not doing the same play every night for six years.
The beauty of that system, despite its challenges, is that you grow older with the characters. You understand them differently each time. I never got bored — not once. She’s trapped, but there’s also an invitation to explore that entrapment. Those questions make “Hedda” endlessly fascinating to me.
How did the gender reversal in the film affect your character and the overall story?
In the original play, Eilert Lövborg is a man — Hedda’s former lover. There’s tension between them, but it’s never fully realized. He’s an alcoholic who tells her wild stories, always returning to her with tales of his debauchery.
But Nia reimagined it completely. Instead of talking about the party, we’re all in it — this one-night pressure cooker. And Eilert becomes Eileen, which changes everything. Now she’s a female writer, openly queer, trying to survive in an academic world that still doesn’t take her seriously. Her battle — to be seen, to be heard, to be respected — is more immediate, more layered.
It also makes the dynamic between the women electrifying. Suddenly, you have this triangle of three complex, nuanced and deeply human female characters. That wasn’t there in the original, and I thought, it was a brilliant decision.
You’ve worked with incredible directors like Nia DaCosta, Todd Field and Christian Petzold. What draws you to these collaborations?
It always begins with the material. That’s the foundation. If something excites me on the page, and I meet the director and we can talk for hours — that’s the sign. We’re aligned in how we see the world, how we want to tell stories. If we connect in conversation, I know we can work well together.
What’s remarkable about Todd, Christian and Nia is that they trust actors. They have a strong vision, yes — but they’re also curious. They want to see what you’ll bring. That sense of trust opens you up. You want to give everything.
With “Hedda,” playing Eileen was a journey through every emotion imaginable. At first, she seems to have it all under control — but then it unravels. There’s something heartbreaking in that, but also something very alive. And being supported by an ensemble like Tessa Thompson, Imogen Poots and Tom Bateman — it was a joy, honestly.
The costumes in the film are visually striking. What was your involvement in shaping Eileen’s look?
Oh, they were essential. Lindsay, our costume designer, was brilliant. We could have gone the expected route — suits, masculine tailoring, a Katharine Hepburn type. But I felt Eileen should be intellectual, yes, but not hiding her body. She doesn’t lead with her sexuality, but she also doesn’t minimize it.
There’s a key scene where her dress becomes translucent when wet, so the fabric had to be carefully chosen. I also thought she needed a corset — she’s a recovering addict stepping back into temptation. The corset helps her hold it together. And the skirt takes up space. When she walks into a room full of men in suits, she claims that space.
Even the imperfections in the costume — the slightly off-shoulder veil, the asymmetry — hint at the cracks in her composure. When a costume does that for you, you don’t have to act it. It’s already speaking.
You split your time between theater and film. How do you choose your projects?
I’ve never made lists of dream roles. Maybe that’s a bit naive, but I believe the right things find you. I’m not Reese Witherspoon or Nicole Kidman, producing my own work — though I admire them deeply. But I trust that if I stay open and committed, the right projects come.
For example, I always dreamed of doing something like “Wild” — a road movie on foot. And this May, I shot “The Other Side” with Mariko Minoguchi, a half-German, half-Japanese director. It’s a dystopian story set in the Alps. I could never have imagined that script, but when it came to me, I grabbed it.
Are you hopeful about the roles available to women, especially those over a “certain age”?
Yes. I really believe it’s our time now — women in our 40s and 50s. There are more of us telling stories, more of us wanting to see our full selves on screen. And I think we’re finding each other. As collaborators, as creators, we’re building space for that representation.
With “Hedda,” there was some hesitation. It’s three women at the helm, and that made some people nervous. But it premiered in Toronto and people wanted to talk about it. The studio stood behind us. Sometimes it takes a moment — but those experiences make me hopeful.
I’ve realized I’m not the one who pushes things into the world — that’s a particular skill set. I help develop and shape the work, and I hang in there. If nothing comes for a while, I trust something will. And that trust, that faith in the work — that’s what keeps me going.

Ethan Hawke had a memorable first visit to Miami on Nov. 2, where he accepted the Miami Film Festival’s Variety Virtuoso Award and sat down with Variety ‘s co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh for a discussion about his long and illustrious career. The actor-producer discussed his collaborations with creatives from Richard Linklater to Taylor Swift and a “scary” screen test that he had with Denzel Washington .
A deserving recipient of the award, Hawke has been having a big year. His starring role in Richard Linklater’s “Blue Moon” is garnering awards buzz; his return as the Grabber in “The Black Phone 2” made a splash at the box office; he starred in “The Lowdown” on FX; directed a documentary about country singer Merle Haggard; and lent his voice to the narration of Apple TV’s “Vietnam: The War That Changed America.” Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Hawke is of a generation of actors who came up in the indie scene of the 1990s. His first movie role was alongside River Phoenix in the 1985 science fiction movie “Explorers.” He then had his first major break  playing one of the students in Peter Weir’s 1989 Robin Williams vehicle, “Dead Poets Society.”
The following year, he watched Richard Linklater’s first film, “Slacker,” which he described as “The first movie that I saw that somebody of my generation made.” Being in a theater troupe with Anthony Rapp, Hawke was then able to see an early cut of “Dazed and Confused” where he “felt an injustice in the universe that I was not in this movie.” The two finally met when Linklater came to one of Hawke’s plays, and they instantly hit it off, talking after the show until four in the morning.
Shortly after, Linklater sent Hawke an early draft of the script for “Before Sunrise” and asked him to audition for the leading man. During the audition, he met his would-be costar, French actress Julie Delpy. “She was so intense,” Hawke said, “She had worked with Godard, she’d worked with Kieślowski, she’d worked with Volker Schlöndorff.” The two were casted as the main couple.
Hawke shared a parable of improvising a scene with Deply, where he is supposed to convince her to get off of a train with him, but Deply insisted that her character never would. Hawke said, “For two weeks I tried to come up with ideas that would talk her into getting off the train, and then I came up with this idea that I was telling her that I was a time traveler and that if she doesn’t get off the train, she’s going to spend the rest of her life wondering what would’ve happened if she had, and if she does, she’ll be so much happier knowing that I’m as boring and stupid as all the other men in her life, but at least she won’t have to wonder.” That got the job done and is indicative of the conversational experimentation that gives the film, and many of Linklater’s works, its charm.
“Before Sunrise” premiered at Sundance in 1995. Reflecting on what are considered the festival’s peak years, though, Hawke said, “What’s funny about it now is that in the moment, we were wishing it was 1972. We weren’t aware that anything special was happening.” He laughed that Linklater, Quentin Tarantino and other emergent filmmakers of the time would obsess over their predecessors like Martin Scorsese and Sidney Lumet and say, “If only I could be making a movie in ’68, then it would be amazing.”
He referenced Woody Allen’s 2011 film “Midnight in Paris” to contextualize the power of hindsight and nostalgia. “I know we’re not allowed to mention him, but whatever,” said Hawke, “Woody Allen has this great movie, ‘Midnight in Paris,’ which is all about how everybody keeps wishing they were living 10 years earlier. I think it’s really true that it’s very difficult for us to live in the moment and accept the moment on its own terms and to see what’s valuable.”
Fortunately, the moment has endured for Hawke. He and Linklater continued to collaborate on eight additional films, including this year’s “Blue Moon,” two sequels to “Before Sunrise” released in 2003 and 2013, and “Boyhood,” which they filmed over the course of 18 years and released in 2014. In between, he has worked with a gamut of other esteemed actors and directors.
One of his more memorable roles was in 2001’s “Training Day,” where he played an LAPD cop alongside Denzel Washington. Hawke recalled the intimidating experience of auditioning for the part with Washington, saying “I came into the screen test and he just didn’t say one scripted line in the entire screen test. He was just improvising with me and it was really difficult to try to keep up with him.”
Hawke credits his experience working with Linklater for allowing him to keep his composure throughout the audition. “I was just telling myself, in my head, ‘Why don’t you just pretend Rick’s in the room?'” he said. “I’ll try not to be intimidated and I just made up lines like I would with Rick.” The tactic worked, as Hawke landed the role and earned his first Oscar nomination for “Training Day.”
Other stars that Hawke has had the privilege of sharing the screen and stage with include Robert De Niro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ben Stiller, Julia Stiles and, as of last year, Taylor Swift in her “Fortnight” music video featuring Post Malone.
The actor thanked his daughter, Maya Hawke, for connecting him with Swift. “My daughter is creating opportunities in my life. I got a text from my daughter saying ‘Hey dad, Taylor Swift wants your number.’ So I guess they met. And anyway, Taylor Swift is a ‘Dead Poets Society’ fan, and so, hell, I’ll take what I can get,” he joked.
Hawke reunited with his “Dead Poets Society” co-star Josh Charles in the project, which Swift wrote and directed herself. “That woman is incredible,” Hawke said of Swift. “To watch her empower herself to direct these videos and take it all on the chin and be willing to stand out front, it is not easy.” The actor was also compelled to see Swift on the Eras tour, which he compared to going to see the Beatles at their cultural height. “Not only is she changing the economy of the world, she has people coming together in a room. Here we are tonight, getting out of our houses, being together, dancing, caring about poetry, caring about ideas, caring about expression. And there’s thousands of thousands of people there rocking out. And I was like, ‘Oh, someday people are going to write books about this moment.'” the actor said.
Hawke concluded the conversation by fielding questions from the audience in the Wolfson Auditorium at Miami-Dade College. In response to a final question about what he’s learned when he returns to his previous work, Hawke admitted to being more focused on the future than the past. “I’m so future-centric,” he said. “No sooner do you get something like a prize like this that it crosses your mind, ‘So is this a high watermark? Have I arrived here? Is it good enough?’ It’s cool. I’m happy. But I’m like, ‘What’s next? Can I do something? I like doing this. Can I do it again? Please? Put me in one more game coach.'”

NY Digital Editor
What’s it like to face the daunting task of playing the three most famous characters and friends from the “ Harry Potter ” Wizarding World?
Variety recently spoke with young British actors Frankie Treadaway (14), Max Lester (13) and Arabella Stanton (11), who provide the voices of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively, in the first three “Harry Potter” audiobooks from Audible . The upshot: All three — who are already accomplished actors with notable credits — were very excited indeed about the opportunity to portray the kid wizards.

Treadaway, asked what his reaction was when he found out he landed the role of Harry Potter in the first three books, said it was one of “just pure amazement, to be honest. With such a famous character, associating you with him is just mind-blowing.” Popular on Variety
Stanton said for her, it was “a pinch-me moment. It’s like, ‘Have I actually got this?’ It was just so amazing when I found out.” (Stanton subsequently landed the part of Hermione in the forthcoming HBO series .) And Lester confessed that his first thought was, “I don’t believe this is real… And still now, I can’t believe that I’m a part of this, and I’m in this amazing role with an amazing cast.”
Are they actual friends the way that Harry, Hermione and Ron are in the “Harry Potter” books? “Well, yeah, of course we are!” said Treadaway. “I think we’ve formed a bond over this period of time when we were doing this.”
The first audiobook in the series, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, Nov. 4, exclusively on Audible, with each of the remaining six releasing monthly worldwide. (A second group of actors — Jaxon Knopf, Rhys Mulligan and Nina Barker-Francis — will voice Harry, Ron and Hermione, respectively, for books 4-7.) The cast of 200-plus actors for the Audible “Harry Potter” books includes Hugh Laurie as Dumbledore and Matthew Macfadyen as Voldemort .
For Treadaway, Stanton and Lester, the amount of time they spent in the recording studio for Audible’s “ Harry Potter: The Full Cast Audio Editions ” was relatively short — about a week or so to cover all three books. Most of the time, they were not together: They recorded their lines separately with other actors speaking the other parts, but the trio did come together for some of the group scenes.
To prepare for the parts, the three said they watched (or rewatched) the Warner Bros. movies starring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. Stanton said she read the original books to understand Hermione’s state of mind at different parts in the story. “I think Hermione can be portrayed in many different ways,” said Stanton. “She’s quite a well-to-do girl — and she is very smart and is very keen to learn.”
For Lester, one challenge was adopting Ron Weasley’s rural English accent. That entailed “getting your vowels longer and making your L’s longer and your R’s longer,” he said. “It was all new to me and it was weird, but I definitely got used to it. And I don’t know, sometimes in conversations now, I kind of slip them in there because it sounds right.”
Lester’s favorite part of the project was recording the scenes in which Ron was eating: Producers prepared and served the actors real food during the sessions. “It was so real!” he said. “It was even better if you did more takes.”
The producers of the “Harry Potter” audiobooks also provide props for the actors to, like the characters’ magic wands and Hogwarts robes. “If you had your wand, if you were doing a spell, you could practice doing that movement,” Stanton said. “And I really think all the tiny little things that they gave us really helped me personally to bring Hermione to life.”
Treadaway, as he was recording, was cognizant of Radcliffe’s line deliveries from the movies. “I definitely did bear in mind what other previous things of Harry Potter were, just so people still have that familiarity with the character,” he said. But he also added “my spin on it.”
Through the experience, Stanton gained an appreciation of the different skills required for voice acting vs. acting for stage or screen. With the former, “you have to focus more on your voice and really portray your character through your voice with more emotion,” she said. “It’s quite hard because you have to sort of not over-enunciate, but really have nice and good diction whilst you’re speaking so that the mic picks up everything you’re saying.”
Their families, of course, have known about their casting in the Audible “Harry Potter” series for months. But the actors weren’t allowed to tell their friends or anyone else about the gigs until they were announced in early August . “When I did finally get round to telling my friends… they were properly impressed,” said Lester. “But when I [couldn’t] tell them, it was quite tough because I really wanted to say what I was doing!”
Treadaway’s West End stage credits include performances in “Mary Poppins,” “Elf,” “Mrs. Doubtfire” and “Matilda the Musical,” while his TV credits include LJP Ltd.’s “My Lady Jane.” Lester’s acting career has included roles in “Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice” (Warner Bros.) and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” (Marvel), as well as stage roles in “Les Misérables” and “Leopoldstadt” in the West End and animation roles on Nickelodeon’s “Best Birthday Ever” and “Barbapapa.” Stanton played the title role in “Matilda the Musical” in the West End at the age of 9, before joining the original cast of “Starlight Express” (London) in the part of Control shortly after she turned 10.
Meanwhile, none of the three have met J.K. Rowling, whose Pottermore Publishing is co-producing “Harry Potter: The Full Cast Audio Editions” with Audible. But they would welcome the chance.
“I love her writing. I love the books,” said Stanton. “Hopefully we get to meet her in the future.”

While no cast has been announced, a source close to the production says that actors who top the wishlist for roles include Scarlett Hefner (“The Vampire Diaries”), as well as Lukas Gage and Patrick Schwarzenegger of “White Lotus” fame. As the feature is in early development, things could shift. Popular on Variety
“This creative partnership reflects Playboy’s commitment to introduce and build out our story-driven content strategy,” said Ben Kohn, CEO of Playboy. “’Dead After Dark’ is another step in a broader company effort to develop a connected Playboy entertainment universe, one that draws from the brand’s vast archives, global influence, and consumer appetite for new IP. We’re excited to see how this first film resonates with audiences and to continue collaborating with great partners to develop additional stories across film, television, and emerging platforms.”
“’Dead After Dark’ is a love letter to both classic genre cinema and Playboy’s legacy as a storytelling platform,” said Cooper Hefner. “Our goal is to create something that’s not only entertaining and emotionally resonant, but also true to the imagination and cultural curiosity that have defined Playboy for more than seventy years. We’re excited to deliver something completely original for Playboy fans that still feels unmistakably familiar.”

TV Business Writer
AMC Networks reported its third-quarter 2025 earnings Friday, revealing a 17% decline in U.S. ad sales for the TV media company and an under 5% reduction in its workforce via voluntary buyout deals.
During that same period, which ran July-September, paid streaming subscribers rose by 200,000 customers across AMC Networks’ portfolio of brands — including AMC+, Acorn TV, Shudder, Sundance Now, ALLBLK and HIDIVE — to reach 10.4 million. Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Overall, domestic streaming revenue rose 14% to $174 million following a price increase across platforms. Popular on Variety
AMC’s linear networks include AMC, BBC AMERICA (which includes U.S. distribution and sales for BBC News), IFC, SundanceTV and We TV. The company also owns film distribution labels Independent Film Company and RLJE Films, and in-house studio AMC Studios.
Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 34 cents on $549.3 million in revenue for AMC Networks, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG. AMC Networks reported adjusted EPS of 18 cents on $562 million in revenue.
“Our performance in the third quarter marks a key milestone in our transition from a cable networks business to a global streaming and technology focused content company,” AMC Networks CEO Kristin Dolan sad in a letter to shareholders. “Streaming revenue growth accelerated and will represent our largest single source of domestic revenue this year. We again delivered healthy free cash flow and remain on track to achieve our increased outlook of $250 million in free cash for the full year. We have built the components of a modern media business that is nimble, independent and well suited to today’s environment and whatever comes next.”
During a call expanding on the quarter in great detail Friday, Dolan announced that less than 5% of AMC Networks’ global workforce recently exited via a voluntary buyout program.
“This program did not have specific financial targets,” Dolan said. “Rather, its purpose was to strengthen our talent base and ensure we have the right skills for the future. The result of this initiative is a less than 5% reduction in our total employee base. We are thankful for the contributions of those who have chosen to pursue new opportunities and, of course, those who are driving this new era of the company.”

TV Business Writer
The soon-to-be-privately-held Electronic Arts saw its sales fall 13% year over year during the July-September quarter, according to the video game giant’s latest earnings results.
Along with the issuing of the financial details Tuesday, the maker of “Madden NFL,” “Battlefield,” “The Sims” and “Apex Legends” said it will forgo its usual quarterly Q&A call between analysts and EA leadership and will no longer be issuing forward-looking financial guidance.

The choice is attributed to EA’s pending $55 billion deal to be taken private by investors including the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners and Silver Lake Group, which was announced Sept. 29 and is on track to be completed by next spring, subject to closing conditions. Popular on Variety
Along with its latest hit release, “Battlefield 6,” EA’s current catalog of titles includes “EA Sports FC” (rebranded from “FIFA”), “Apex Legends,” “The Sims,” “EA Sports,” “Skate,” “Madden NFL,” “EA Sports College Football,” “Need for Speed,” “Dragon Age,” “Titanfall,” “Plants vs. Zombies” and “EA Sports F1,” among others.
According to EA, wins from the latest quarter, which marked EA’s second quarter of its fiscal 2026, included: “Madden NFL 26” fueling year-over-year net bookings growth, “Apex Legends” returning to double digit sales growth, and an increase in “EA Sports FC 26 HD” net bookings compared to last year’s title, “after adjusting for differences in deluxe edition content timing.”
Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 35 cents on $1.87 billion in revenue for the quarter, according to analyst consensus data provided by LSEG. EA reported non-GAAP diluted EPS of 54 cents on $1.82 billion in net bookings ($1.84 billion in revenue).
That net bookings figure was down 13% from the $2.1 billion in net bookings EA posted from July-September 2024, which EA attributes to especially strong sales for “College Football 25” at that time.
EA had itself projected net bookings between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the latest quarter, and diluted EPS between 29 cents and 46 cents. Net income for the quarter stood at $137 million, overshooting EA’s projection between $73 million and $117 million.
“Across our broad portfolio — from ‘EA Sports’ to ‘Battlefield,’ ‘The Sims,’ and ‘skate.’ — our teams continue to create high-quality experiences that connect and inspire players around the world,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson said in a letter to shareholders accompanying the results. “The creativity, passion, and innovation of our teams are at the heart of everything we do.”

TV Business Writer
A revamped version of the esports league tied to the “ NBA 2K ” video game franchise launched Monday with a new focus on original, entertainment programming starring NBA players, content creators, and celebrities.
Led by NBA Take-Two Media (NBAT2), a joint venture between the NBA and “NBA 2K” publisher Take-Two Interactive Software, the new NBA 2K League is described as “an innovative entertainment property where competition meets culture, bringing everyone from fans to NBA players and creators together to play, compete, and build community—no matter their ‘NBA 2K’ skill level.” Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Run by NBAT2 CEO Andrew Perlmutter, who has been working to reimagine the league since changes were first announced in July 2024, the new 2KL will feature “original content that showcases NBA players and creators competing against each other in unexpected settings, the season will also include online and in-person tournaments, as well as a first-of-its-kind open-ladder competition that places fans directly in the action.” Popular on Variety
Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick tells Variety the “main objective” in the league overhaul “is to serve our consumers and to bring them great entertainment that is at the intersection of basketball, ‘NBA 2K’ and just general entertainment.”
“The idea is, show them a good time and make sure that good time is related to ‘NBA 2K,'” Zelnick said. “And the ‘NBA 2K’ universe is huge. It’s not just a simulation game, it’s a lifestyle. It used to be that we put the game out, people would play it for a couple of months and then go on to the rest of their life. Now, ‘NBA 2K’ is a reflection of a cultural interest in all things basketball, in the same way that when you watch a basketball game in person, you’re not just there to see the game, you’re there to be with your friends and to have some food and to cheer and to wear this shirt, and you’re there for affinity and an experience, not just the game itself. So with ‘NBA 2K,’ there’s the game itself, the sim, which is amazing and the best there is, and there’s everything surrounding that.”
The league has named “2K” fan and celebrity streamer Jesser, who boasts more than 35 million YouTube subscribers, as the “honorary commissioner.” Jesser and his team and board of celebrity guests “will serve as the guiding force behind the league — working together to draft players, issue rulings and keep everyone on their toes.”
“He’s highly credible in basketball. He knows basketball,” Zelnick says of Jesser. “He’s highly credible with the video game because he knows and plays a video again. And he’s highly entertaining. That’s sort of in a nutshell what we’re trying to do here. Now, if we do it right, that’s going to create a lot of revenue. And we’re a commercial enterprise, so is the NBA — but our job is to captivate and engage our consumers. That’s what we hope to do here. And we think Andrew has rethought this, in a way. Because purely as a competition, it’s sort of interesting, and there are a lot of people who watched it, we had a lot of viewers. But I think to reframe this as a competitive situation within a lifestyle is much more interesting, much more compelling.”
The inaugural season of the new league tips off with “MyPLAYER Mayhem” — a creator and player-led 2KL competitive reality series that brings their personalities, fanbases, and rivalries into play, on Nov. 4 on the 2K League YouTube channel.
Then beginning Nov. 16, fans can sign up for “Next Fan Up,” the new open ladder competition.
The league re-launch is accompanied by a multi-year partnership agreement with the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) which will allow the league to work directly with NBA players to “unlock greater opportunities to participate in the 2KL, giving NBAT2 the ability to develop stories around specific players.”
“The launch of the new NBA 2K League is an exciting step forward as we engage the next generation of players, creators and fans,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. “We’re proud to support the evolution of 2K and the numerous ways that the basketball community connects with our sport.”
Per the new league description. “The 2KL breaks boundaries by inviting everyone to participate and will launch with six teams: Boston Celtics, Detroit Pistons, Memphis Grizzlies, Toronto Raptors, Utah Jazz and Washington Wizards. Each team will be represented by a unique duo of creators and NBA players, including Zach 2K, BEARDABEAST, Kofie Yeboah, Gradey Dick, and Duncan Robinson, as well as a select number of fans who have risen through the ranks of 2K gameplay. Throughout the season, they will face off in a series of challenges—on the virtual court and in live events—for one-of-a-kind experiences that showcase the unfiltered personalities of each player.”
“We’ll be running an open competition for any ‘2K’ user,” NBAT2 CEO Andrew Perlmutter told Variety. “So any ‘2K’ user can affiliate with his or her favorite NBA team, and over the course of the six months, there will be opportunities for those users to earn points, rise the ranks on a leaderboard, and ultimately have an opportunity to represent his or her favorite NBA team in official competition — and then potentially participate in some of the programming with NBA players and celebrities. And importantly, how much you play ‘2K’ and a variety of social media challenges are just as important in earning these points as being excellent at ‘2K.’ So we widen the aperture of who has an opportunity to use their love of ‘2K,’ their love of basketball culture, to actually participate in the league. We think this sort of entertainment-oriented approach that gives us access to who our favorite NBA players and celebrities are in sort of authentic, unfiltered moments of competition and camaraderie, gives us an opportunity to create an entertainment universe that is really powerful and hits this intersection of culture in a really unique way.”

Nintendo is releasing “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” soundtrack on vinyl in the U.S. in a first for the Japanese video game company, which has traditionally focused its physical music media efforts in Japan.
In partnership with Laced Records, Nintendo will release the vinyl collaboration June 19, 2026: a double LP and an 8-LP box set, both available as limited-edition colored vinyl or standard black vinyl and featuring archival artwork created by the game development team. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
The double LP will be priced at $49.99, for both the limited and standard editions, while the 8 LP retails for $194.99. Pre-purchase for the limited-edition colored vinyl collections is available Wednesday on My Nintendo Store and at Laced Records. Popular on Variety
Per Nintendo, “The 8-LP Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Soundtrack Box Set includes 130 tracks, all newly remastered for the vinyl format. Each of the eight discs is sequenced around a theme, which mirrors the progression of the game experience. Themes revolve around exploring the Kingdom of Hyrule, freeing the Divine Beasts from Calamity Ganon’s hold and discovering the mysteries of the Shrines.”
The double-LP set features 34 select tracks, including “Overworld (Day),” “Great Fairy Fountain,” and “Hyrule Castle,” “all chosen to create an aural landscape that transports listeners back to the final days of the Great Calamity.”
Created by composers Manaka Kataoka, Yasuaki Iwata, Hajime Wakai and Soshi Abe, the “Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” soundtrack’s vinyl release is a test case for future releases in the U.S. market.
“In the Japanese market, CD is still a pretty prominent format there, and they do a lot of video game soundtracks on CD in Japan, and they’ve been doing that for years and years,” Nintendo Vice President, Player & Product Experience Bill Trinen told Variety . “Here in the U.S., we haven’t been releasing much in the way of physical soundtracks at all. And so partly, this is a little bit about us trying to gauge and understand what is the demand for physical soundtracks in the United States. Part of this is also simply an interest in trying to bring video game music to a broader audience, and it’s part of a few steps that we’ve taken.”
The announcement of the “Zelda” vinyl release comes as Nintendo is celebrating a different musical milestone: the one-year anniversary of its music streaming service for Switch Online subscribers.
“This week actually, is the one year anniversary of the release of Nintendo Music, which is an exclusive music streaming service for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers,” Trinen said. “There’s an app that you can download for your phone that has retro soundtracks dating back to the NES era, all the way up to more modern soundtracks from the Switch, and even some music from the Switch 2 era on it, as well. So we’re really trying to broaden exposure to our overall very, very large music library, but also then trying to find different ways to deliver it to different fans of music.”

Amid lawsuits over likeness and IP infringement as the use of generative AI rises, Genies says it “packages AI in an IP-safe digital asset framework for the next era of fan engagement, one built from the ground up to ensure that every digital identity is properly protected and leveraged authentically, while still allowing talent to capture the upside benefits of AI.”
“We are entering a time when the rules of digital identity, likeness, and creative ownership are being rewritten,” Genies director of business development and strategy Jake Becker said. “As platforms like OpenAI’s Sora face questions about likeness use without consent, and as talent agencies look to enforce client rights, the need for control and protection has never been clearer. Our goal is to let talent bring their visual AI identity to life as dynamic, interactive companions they own and manage. By building clear guardrails and control, we ensure they can safely engage audiences while maintaining ownership of their digital selves and unlocking new, authentic ways to connect and monetize.”

Senior Film and Media Reporter
Huntr/x will return to the screen… but the girl group’s reunion tour might take a while.
Netflix and Sony have finalized a deal for another “ KPop Demon Hunters ” movie, with plans to release the animated musical sequel in 2029, as first reported by Bloomberg . Animated films can take a long time to make, hence the potential four-year gap between installments. Of course, release date plans could change depending on the film’s production schedule.

Netflix and Sony declined to comment. Popular on Variety
“KPop Demon Hunters,” a fantasy adventure about a fictional K-pop girl group who protect the world from demons with their music, was developed and produced by Sony Pictures Animation. As part of Sony’s licensing deal with Netflix, “KPop Demon Hunters” landed directly on Netflix and became the streamer’s most popular movie of all time. Meanwhile, three of its original songs — “Golden,” “Your Idol” and “Soda Pop” — have been mainstays on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart and could land nominations at the upcoming Grammy Awards.
“KPop Demon Hunters” has been such a phenomenon that the theatrical-averse Netflix decided to bring a sing-along version of the film to theaters for fan events in August and October. During the first go-around, “KPop Demon Hunters” topped the box office with roughly $18 million over two days. Then around Halloween, the movie collected $5 million to $6 million, which is noteworthy considering it’s been widely available on streaming for months.
“KPop Demon Hunters co-director Maggie Kang, who helmed the film with Chris Appelhans, has long expressed her desire for a sequel.
“We’ve set up so much for potential backstory,” Kang told Variety in July . “Obviously, there’s a lot of questions that are left unanswered and areas that are not explored. We had to do that because there’s only so much movie you could tell in 85 minutes.”

Artisans Editor
Colleen Atwood is no stranger to creating dazzling costumes for musicals, counting such spectacles as “Nine” and “Chicago” among her credits.
Now, she can add Bill Condon’s “ Kiss of the Spider Woman ” to that list. In Condon’s adaptation of the Broadway musical, Atwood crafted a wardrobe for Jennifer Lopez’s dual characters of Ingrid Luna and Aurora/Spider Woman that ranges from an elite working woman’s wardrobe (Aurora is head of a fashion glossy) to movie star looks, calling back to the Golden Age of MGM musicals.

Atwood was familiar with Manuel Puig’s 1976 book, and subsequently saw Héctor Babenco’s 1985 film adaptation and the Broadway musical. Popular on Variety
Atwood’s designs reference those previous iterations. In one sequence, Lopez wears a cream suit with a hat. “That outfit really is an homage to Chita from the musical because she wore a white suit,” she says, referring to Chita Rivera, who won a Tony playing the character on Broadway and the West End, and passed away just as Condon began filming. “We started with more of a white suit, like [Marlene] Dietrich, and then it became white shorts and then it became just the jacket,” Atwood says. The costume designer says the look evolved because once the choreography “came into the equation,” it was easier for Lopez to dance in just the chic jacket. Atwood adds, “It was simpler just to do, go for the legs and the jacket look. It was classic, Broadway.”
A navy-blue suit consisted of a skirt and jacket, and nods to the working girl. Atwood added chiffon to the hem for movement. “It runs up the back, but when she starts moving in it, you can see it swirl around her.” The jacket was loosely inspired by a photo of star Rosalind Russell.
Early on, Ingrid dons a gold dress. Atwood points out all the beads were sewn on by hand and made from glass. “It lights like glass,” she says. “It’s like her armor.”
As for Aurora’s/Spider Woman’s finale look, Atwood says that, for years, she had a swatch of fabric that the character would play with. “You could pull it and it was like a web. But it was less rigid, and I was waiting for the opportunity to use it.” When she got the job on “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” Atwood knew she had to make a costume with it. She ordered the fabric but added touches to make the black pop off the screen. “I didn’t want it to also be black and not be able to be seen,” Atwood says, “so I did a silver base behind it to reflect the light in the room. But you could still get light coming off it, rather than just a black shade.”

NY Digital Editor
Kylie Kelce is going to “fuck around and find out” — in a positive way — on a regular basis.
Kelce, who is married to former NFL pro Jason Kelce, has drawn a sizable audience for her podcast “Not Gonna Lie” podcast since it launched in December 2024. The show is produced and distributed by Wave , the media company the co-developed and launched the hit “New Heights” podcast from brothers Jason and Travis Kelce.

Kylie Kelce had a viral moment when she espoused her approach to “ FAFO parenting”: letting your kids go through with their actions — even potentially hurtful ones — without intervening, to let them learn from the experience. Now she and Wave are launching “FAFO,” a new limited series premiering Nov. 4 exclusively available on YouTube with new episodes releasing monthly. Popular on Variety
The “FAFO mentality is a way of life for Kylie Kelce and now she’s taking it as literally as ever,” according to Wave’s announcement of the new series. Every episode features a new “fuck around” activity, ranging from running field hockey drills with a pro athlete to getting up close and personal with animals, all while Kylie asks the questions we all want the answer to — i.e., the “find out” part. Fans can expect even more of her “signature brand of hilarious, unfiltered realness, because as the Real Ones know, that’s her only setting,” per Wave.
In a statement provided to Variety , Kelce said: “After repeated requests from the ‘Not Gonna Lie’ fan base, we have decided to answer the call for more content with ‘FAFO.’ What better way to do that than to learn a thing or two from experts on topics that I’m curious about. In partnership with Wave, who have helped build the podcast into what it is, we will continue our mission to create entertaining and meaningful episodes.”
In the first episode of “FAFO,” Kylie teams with Nicki Marie, former NCAA Championship-winning field hockey player, coach and content creator. With the backdrop of Kylie’s latest youth field hockey clinic “Stick With PHL,” she and Nicki practice hitting slap shots and give a Field Hockey 101 demonstration, all while formulating their plan to get more girls involved in the sport that shaped them.
“We’re thrilled to deepen our partnership with Kylie and give fans exactly what they’ve been asking for — more Kylie,” said Mack Sovereign, chief content officer at Wave (formerly known as Wave Sports & Entertainment). “’FAFO’ is a natural next step in expanding ‘Not Gonna Lie’ out of the studio, in a way that stays true to Kylie’s voice, and maintains the authenticity that so many people find relatable and refreshing.” Toyota and Liquid IV have signed on as launch sponsors for the first two episodes of “FAFO.”
Variety named Kylie Kelce as part of its 2025 class of New Leaders , recognizing movers and shakers in the industry figures under 40. “Not Gonna Lie With Kylie Kelce” debuted at No. 1 on Apple and Spotify and held the top spot for two weeks. The series has amassed over 463 million views across social media since launch, and won the award for best emerging podcast” at the 2025 iHeartPodcast Awards.
Santa Monica-based Wave’s other shows, which span sports and pop culture, include “House of Maher” with Ilona Maher, “Open Thought with Funny Marco,” “Almost Athletes with Dude Perfect,” “Straight to Cam” with Cameron Brink and Sydel Curry-Lee, “Podcast P with Paul George,” “7PM in Brooklyn” with Carmelo Anthony, “The Right Time With Bomani Jones” and “Fitz & Whit.”

Tyler Perry is putting his spin on the classic holiday movie genre with his latest rom-com, “ Finding Joy .”
The movie, now streaming on Prime Video, follows the unlikely love story of Joy and Ridge, played by Shannon Thornton and Tosin Morohunfola . The plot centers on Joy (Thornton), a New York-based fashion designer, who is overlooked at work. With the encouragement of her friends, Ashley (Brittany S. Hall) and Littia (Inayah), Joy, a hopeless romantic, follows her crush, Colton (Aaron O’Connell), to Colorado to meet his family — under the impression that the trip will take their relationship to the next level. But upon arrival, Joy quickly gets friend-zoned when her crush reveals he has a fiancée. Joy attempts to book a flight back to the city, but finds herself stranded in the middle of a snowstorm and suffers a near-fatal car crash. Ridge (Morohunfola) not only saves her life but also reshapes her outlook on everything — especially, love.

But “Finding Joy” isn’t your typical Hallmark-esque film where a successful single woman from the city adopts a newfound appreciation for Christmas in a small town after falling for a handsome, local man. Instead, the film separates itself from the genre’s cheesier elements by inviting audiences on a heartfelt journey that explores the true meaning of love, resilience and personal growth found in unexpected circumstances. Plus, Perry puts an emphasis on spotlighting Black love.​ Popular on Variety
“It’s Black ,” Thornton tells Variety , emphasizing what makes this story unique. “It’s the Black experience. It’s how we actually talk to each other.”
​Over the years, audiences have critiqued Perry for perpetuating negative stereotypes and centering Black women in limited storylines that are mired in struggle, hardships and trauma. However, “Finding Joy” veers away from those tropes and combines themes of grief, heartbreak and sisterhood to highlight hope, healing and the transformative power of love.
“I love that it’s just unexpected, and they’re kind of just going with what they feel, and not really playing games,” Thornton says. “They’re forced together in almost unnatural circumstances, and they just came together in a beautiful and unexpected way. It’s a really nice, really adorable way to show Black love on screen.”
Working with Perry was an adventure all its own. While it wasn’t Thornton’s first time taking part in one of Perry’s productions — she was a supporting player in his Netflix movie “Mea Culpa” — it was both the actors’ first time as his main stars.
“He welcomed me with open arms,” Morohunfola says about meeting Perry for the first time. “He empowered me to feel like I could make the character my own and also honor his vision at the same time. I knew I was in good hands.”
Perry’s famously fast production schedule took some getting used to, though. “Finding Joy” was shot in just five days, so the pressure was on.
“It was a fun and exciting challenge for me as an actor,” Thornton says. “I’m like, ‘What can I do if I had this amount of time and not be reliant on so many takes?’ I’m really happy with what I did given the amount of time I had.”
But Thornton can’t take all the credit for memorizing the script so quickly; Perry had a group of readers on set who helped run lines. “I wasn’t sure I could do it, or if I was capable of memorizing so much in a short amount of time, but I did it,” she adds. “As an actor, I was able to make very honest choices and still be fully in it, and have little moments of nuance.”
Audiences might recognize Thornton as Keyshawn from the Starz series “P-Valley.” But her role on the ensemble drama didn’t compare to what stepping into her first leading film role required, and she battled instances of “imposter syndrome” and “self-doubt.”
​“I had a little bit of experience while shooting ‘P-Valley’ Season 2, when Keyshawn gets her own episode. I got that little feeling in my belly like, ‘Can I do this? Am I capable of carrying something like this on my own?’” Thornton says of preparing for the part. “It’s the little moments of doubting yourself. And you have to say, ‘I deserve to be here. I’m going to receive all of these great things coming my way. I’m absolutely capable.’ That’s when the training comes in, and all the hard work that you put in for years leading up to this moment.”
That’s one of the ways Thornton resonated with Joy, whose pursuit of launching her own fashion line resembled Thornton’s journey as an actor. (Thornton lived in New York for 11 years, trying to get her big break.) “That’s how I can relate to her,” Thornton says of sharing a similar backstory with the character. “The hustle of having something to do and somewhere to be as soon as you wake up. The discomfort of your situation being the catalyst that gets you going.”
Similarly, Morohunfola also identified with Ridge’s country upbringing — raised in Greensburg, Kan., Morohunfola’s was the only Black family in the small, rural town — but what resonated most was the love story unfolding between the two characters.
“That happens all the time: people whom you don’t think that you’re supposed to be connected to, somehow you feel a connection with, and they unlock something in you that you never knew needed to be unlocked. That’s as human as could be,” he explains. “I’ve experienced that in the past. The best part of life is the magic of love in unexpected places.”
Morohunfola admits he isn’t the biggest fan of holiday movies, but when he first read the script for “Finding Joy,” Ridge’s range of emotions stood out.
“Not every holiday movie has depth, and that’s something that drew me to this one,” he explains. “When I saw Ridge, I immediately saw somebody more than two-dimensional. On the outside, he has a rough exterior, but underneath that, you’ve got a vulnerable, loving and caring person who needs the help of the right person to bring that out.”
He adds: “I always look for characters with layers that remind me of men that I’ve seen in my life and can identify with. There are a lot of people walking around with pain that makes them seem tough on the outside, but they’re capable of love like anybody else.”
Morohunfola hopes that audiences will come away from the film having learned something about love.
“This film does a good job of depicting how love doesn’t care about those boundaries,” Morohunfola says. “Joy thinks she’s high class and above Ridge as a city girl. Ridge is a rural, country boy who doesn’t care for social media or any basic modernity. But it doesn’t matter how different they are culturally, because what brings them together is stronger than any of that.”

Did they do that ? A retrospective podcast on classic sitcom “ Family Matters ” is coming soon, in the latest project looking to mine nostalgia for TV hits of yore.
“Welcome to the Family With Telma and Kellie,” from iHeartMedia ‘s podcast division, is co-hosted by cast members Kellie Williams (who played middle daughter Laura Winslow) and Telma Hopkins (Aunt Rachel). On each episode of the podcast, the duo will share their personal reflections in making “Family Matters,” one of the longest-running sitcoms with a Black cast, and discuss their favorite episodes and characters — as well as bring some other fellow cast members into the conversation.

Guests on “Welcome to the Family” will include series producer Bob Boyett, Reggie VelJohnson (Carl Winslow) and Shawn Harrison (Waldo Faldo). Hopkins and Williams also will answer listener questions about the show. In the first episode, the hosts will discuss their personal journey to being cast on the series, their favorite moments from filming the pilot and the episode’s storyline. Popular on Variety
The podcast will premiere Nov. 5 on iHeartRadio app and across all major audio platforms. New episodes will be available weekly on subsequent Wednesdays. ( Listen to the trailer below. )
Williams said in a statement, “To this day, ‘Family Matters’ is one of the most-streamed sitcoms and it is an honor for me to be able to go back in time and remember what it was like as a kid to grow up on the show and go through some of the same things my character, Laura Winslow, did. Not to mention doing it with my surrogate mom, Telma, who’s become one of my closest friends and is really another member of my family, as well as reconnecting with fans and hearing how the show impacted them. We hope fans enjoy listening to these episodes as much as we have enjoyed making them!”
Hopkins added, “My time on ‘Family Matters’ was one of the highlights not just of my career, but my life, the friendships I made have lasted decades, so it is incredibly gratifying to relive these episodes with Kellie, who I consider to be one of my ‘kids,’ and talk about each episode — from the storylines you know to the behind-the-scenes stuff you don’t. The fun for me is that I can truly watch as an ‘audience member’ now, and I’m loving it! Welcome to the family, y’all!”
“Welcome to the Family” is produced by Audiation, a New York-based podcast company that produces commissioned and original series in partnership with brands, celebrities and creators. Audiation originals include “Gender Spiral with Ally Beardsley and Babette Thomas,” “Leaving the Island” and “Four Strings and the Truth.”
ABC aired nine seasons of “Family Matters” from 1989-1998. All episodes of “Family Matters” are currently available on Disney’s Hulu.
“Family Matters,” which was a spinoff of “Perfect Strangers,” followed the Chicago-based Winslow family. Its breakout character was nerdy boy genius Steve Urkel, played by Jaleel White, whose famous catchphrase was “Did I do that?” (Steve Urkel, who lived next door to the Winslows, had a crush on Laura.) Per Hulu’s description of the show: “The extended Winslow family redefines the word ‘togetherness’ as their home splits at the seams with chaos, confusion and laughter.”
Williams, born and raised in Washington, D.C., began her acting career at the age of 4. Her breakout moment came with a home video audition, filmed by her father, that secured her the iconic role of Laura Winslow on “Family Matters.”
Hopkins is an actress and singer who first gained fame as a member of pop group Tony Orlando and Dawn. She got her start as a teenager in Detroit singing background vocals on some of Motown’s most memorable hits like “Reach Out,” “Heard It Through the Grapevine” and “That’s The Way Love Is,” as well as Isaac Hayes’ classic soundtrack from the movie “Shaft.” After her singing career, Hopkins appeared in sitcoms including “Bosom Buddies,” Gimme a Break!” and “Family Matters,” earning multiple NAACP Image Award nominations and a BET Comedy Award.

International Correspondent
Italian director Margherita Ferri, whose “ The Boy With Pink Pants ” was the country’s top local 2024 hit, is back behind the camera on “Piercing.” Her next film is a genre-bending feminist and queer fable with a cast including her “Pink Pants” protagonist.
Shooting started Monday in Bologna on “Piercing,” which is set in the city’s working-class Pilastro neighborhood. The plot focuses on an inseparable trio of 17-year-old friends — Gemma, Alex and Lauriana — “whose lives take an unexpected turn when a lip piercing seems to grant them mysterious superpowers,” according to the synopsis.

“When Gemma gives birth, her mother insists on giving the baby up, convinced she cannot handle the responsibility. Refusing to accept this, the girls run away with the newborn, using their newfound powers to escape,” the description continues. “What begins as a reckless flight soon becomes a transformative journey, forcing them to confront the true weight of their powers.” Popular on Variety
“Piercing” features emerging talents Beatrice Savignani as Gemma, Alicia Edogamhe (“Those About to Die”) as Alex and Lisa Pires Lima as Lauriana. Rounding off the cast are Samuele Carrino, who played the lead in “The Boy With Pink Pants”; Andrea Arru (“The Boy With Pink Pants”); Barbora Bobulova (“A Brighter Tomorrow,” “Portobello”); Italian singer and actress Thony; and Francesco Colella (Netflix’s “The Leopard”).
In her director’s statement, Ferri said “Piercing” seeks “to break away from the canons of all the genres it draws inspiration from: Italian post-neorealism, superhero films, science fiction, queer cinema and European auteur cinema.” She added that “the most interesting challenge is maintaining the balance between the realism of the characters and the film’s supernatural element.”
Ferri continued: “The film’s events also stem from the many encounters I’ve had during my work as a documentary filmmaker and during film workshops in schools. From those experiences, I absorbed a bold view of the world; the beautiful recklessness of youth who feel invincible and fearless. This prompted the need to tell this story: an irreverent coming-of-age tale with a strong dose of girl-power, in which both daughters and parents find themselves on a journey of growth. The main theme, in fact, is the changing perception of femininity among the new generations.”
Ferri studied at the University of Bologna, at UCLA in Los Angeles and is also a graduate of Rome’s Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, where she trained with Paolo Sorrentino and Marco Bellocchio. Last year, she scored a surprise megahit with “The Boy With Pink Pants,” which depicts the harrowing true tale of a 15-year-old boy who took his own life after enduring bullying at school and online. The teen drama became the big box office winner in 2024, grossing more than $9 million and beating high-profile Hollywood titles such as “Wicked” and “Venom 3.” A U.S. remake is in the works to be directed by Nick Cassavetes.
“I’m very happy to be able to return to the set with a story I wrote, after ‘The Boy with the Pink Pants,’ which I cherish as a wonderful experience and the relationships with some of the cast members who supported me on this crazy project: Samuele Carrino and Andrea Arru,” Ferri said.
“Piercing” is being produced by Carlo Cresto-Dina’s Tempesta with RAI Cinema, in co-production with Switzerland’s tellfilm. RAI Cinema’s 01 Distribution will release in Italy. The film’s producers are Carlo Cresto-Dina and Manuela Melissano.
Cresto-Dina is known for shepherding works by young directors who have gone on to make a major splash, such as Alice Rohrwacher, all of whose works he has produced.
“With ‘Piercing,’ our research continues towards a cinema that can appeal to a broad audience, without giving up on provocation,” the producers said in a statement. “In Margherita Ferri’s fantastic story, it’s the daughters who teach their mothers how to dare and win; how to rediscover the superpowers of the feminine within themselves.”

TV Business Writer
Netflix has shut down Boss Fight Entertainment, the studio behind its hit mobile game based on the “ Squid Game ” franchise.
The two games the developer has released for the streamer, the “Netflix Stories” ( which had already stopped releasing new titles earlier this year ) series and “Squid Game: Unleashed,” will continue to be available via Netflix, Variety has learned.
The studio closure comes as Netflix continues to adjust its gaming strategy under president Alain Tascan, who joined the company in July 2024. The games division, which launched in November 2021, is now focused on party games ( a slew of which will be released this holiday seaso n), narrative games, kids games and mainstream games, as well as games played directly on TVs versus mainly mobile titles. Popular on Variety Related Stories AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth' 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE)
Netflix first began this pivot when it closed its AAA video game studio , known as Team Blue, last October before the developer had released a project.
However, the shuttering of Boss Fight (which was acquired by Netflix in 2022) is still a shock, considering that “Squid Game: Unleashed” had been touted as a very successful title by Netflix upon its release last December, and Netflix continues to emphasize the importance of developing content around its owned IP.
Netflix declined to comment Friday.
“Hi everyone – well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure,” Boss Fight co-founder and CEO David Rippy said in a statement posted to LinkedIn Thursday . “Thanks, everyone who reached out today. Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including Squid Game Unleased which hit #1 in 26 countries. You’ll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles – they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me – we’re going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there’s anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise.”

NY Digital Editor
Could Netflix become the future home of the DC Universe’s Superman and Batman superhero films, the Harry Potter and Barbie film franchises — and owner of a trove of classics like “Casablanca,” “Bonnie and Clyde,” “Goodfellas,” “Unforgiven” and “The Shining”?
The streaming powerhouse is “actively exploring” some type of acquisition bid for Warner Bros. Discovery and has retained investment bank Moelis & Co. to put together a prospective offer, according to a new report from Reuters , citing anonymous individuals. Moelis was the financial adviser to David Ellison’s Skydance Media in its takeover of Paramount Global to former Paramount Skydance. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
Warner Bros. Discovery’s board last week announced that it had received in-bound M&A interest from “multiple parties” and has commenced a process to review such offers. Per the Reuters report, WBD has granted Netflix access to its financials as part of assembling a prospective M&A offer. It’s not clear if a Netflix bid would also include Warner Bros. Discovery’s HBO Max business. Popular on Variety
Representatives for Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery and Moelis & Co. declined to comment Friday.
Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors on its Q3 earnings interview last week that the company has “no interest in owning legacy media networks,” indicating that an acquisition of WBD in its entirety — including networks like CNN, TBS, HGTV and Food Network — is off the table. Sarandos did say Netflix can be “choosy” about its M&A targets, but he added: “Nothing is a must-have for us to meet our goals that we have for the business.”
Netflix’s reported active interest in buying perhaps some of WBD’s assets comes as Paramount Skydance’s Ellison has made aggressive overtures — with three escalating bids for the entire company . WBD has rejected all three as too low, including Ellison’s most recent one for $23.50/share.
Comcast also is said to be looking at a potential bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, although, like Netflix, seemingly just for the studios and/or streaming side of the house. Mike Cavanagh, Comcast co-CEO, told analysts during Comcast’s Q3 earnings call Thursday morning that “the bar is high” for the company to consider a major merger of acquisition. But he didn’t rule anything out — and suggested that Comcast’s ability to secure federal approval for any transaction would improve once the spinoff of its linear cable channels (other than Bravo) into Versant is completed later this year.
Cavanagh said that “what we’d be looking for and what we’re going to look like post-Versant spin, I think more things are viable than maybe some of the public commentary that’s out there.”
Box-office hits in 2025 for Warner Bros.’s film studios, in a turnaround from past years, have included James Gunn’s “Superman,” “A Minecraft Movie,” Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan’s “Sinners,” “Final Destination Bloodlines,” Brad Pitt’s “F1: The Movie,” and “Weapons.” In 2024, the studios segment’s highlights were “Dune: Part Two,” “Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice” and “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” on the film side.
Meanwhile, Warner Bros. Television has produced shows for Netflix including “Running Point,” “You” and “Maid.” Other top-rated shows from WB Television include “Abbott Elementary,” “Shrinking” and “The Voice.”

Variety Editor at Large
Carol Burnett has been brewin’ something big with the Bruins. The UCLA alum and Hollywood icon has announced two major gifts to the school: An endowment to establish a scholarship at the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, as well as a donation of the more than 140 industry awards and honors that Burnett has received over her seven-decade career.
Among those awards are seven Emmys — ranging from outstanding performance in a variety or music program in 1962 (“The Garry Moore Show”) to outstanding variety special—pre-recorded (“Carol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter+Love”) in 2023. She’s also won six Golden Globes, a Grammy, a Tony, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Kennedy Center Honor, multiple Peabody Awards, a Stephen Sondheim Award, a 1976 Creative Circle Award (shaped like a golden typewriter), the SAG Lifetime Achievement Award, the Globes’ first Carol Burnett Lifetime Achievement Award for Television and much more.

As part of the donation, Burnett also included ephemera such as hand drawings of her in costume from “The Carol Burnett Show,” a still-boxed doll of her in the CBS variety show’s iconic Scarlett O’Hara curtain hanger costume, and other photos and memorabilia. A rotating display of Burnett’s honors will be shown in the lobby of UCLA’s Freud Playhouse. Popular on Variety
Also included (above) is another award that is appropriate to the UCLA donation: A “Spotlight Award” from June 1952, honoring Burnett as “most outstanding newcomer” in the UCLA one-act program during the spring 1952 semester.
The timing of the donation coincides with the announcement Thursday of the Carol Burnett Endowed Undergraduate Scholarship in Music Theater. Under the scholarship, one undergraduate student each year in the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television’s Ray Bolger Musical Theater Program  will receive what’s described as a “substantial award” to help cover the cost of tuition and fees.
“I am so pleased that, with this endowment of the Carol Burnett Scholarship to the UCLA School of Theater, Film & Television, students will be given an opportunity akin to what UCLA gave me when I enrolled fresh out of high school,” Burnett said in a statement. “I found my true passion at UCLA, and in this scholarship lies the hope that it will do the same for many others for many years to come.”
This year’s grantee is first-year theater major Alexa Cruz, a member of the class of 2029. Cruz’s community theater experience includes performing songs connected to past Burnett roles, including “Little Girls” (from “Annie”) and “Shy” (from “Once Upon a Mattress”). Burnett made her Broadway debut as Princess Winnifred the Woebegone in “Once Upon a Mattress,” which landed her a Tony nom in 1960, and starred as Miss Hannigan in the 1982 film version of “Annie.”
“As a first-generation college student, this scholarship will help me pursue my dreams of becoming an actress and make my goals feel more attainable,” Cruz said. “This financial assistance will greatly support my educational expenses. I’m truly humbled by this opportunity and excited to continue pursuing my degree at UCLA and my passion for musical theater.”
Most recently, Burnett has been seen in “Better Call Saul,” “Hacks” and “Palm Royale,” which was created by another UCLA alum, Abe Sylvia.
Burnett and Sylvia will visit UCLA on Thursday to introduce a Season 2 premiere screening of “Palm Royale” in the James Bridges Theater.
“Carol Burnett has led one of the most visionary, joyful and prolific careers in the history of multiple entertainment industries,” said UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television dean Celine Parreñas Shimizu. “She created new paths every time something blocked her way. She created new forms within the industry for herself and others to thrive. Her approach to craft is completely aligned with the spirit of what we teach our brilliant students at TFT. Carol Burnett’s voice has always been, and will always be, part of our story as we train upcoming generations to follow her bold and tenacious example.”

NY Digital Editor
Adobe and YouTube are teaming up in a first-of-its-kind partnership aimed at getting more YouTubers to use the recently launched Adobe Premiere mobile app for iPhone — to ideally produce a ton more YouTube Shorts videos.
Under a new partnership between Adobe and YouTube, the free Adobe Premiere mobile app (launched last month for iOS) will soon add Create for YouTube Shorts. The new content-creation space will provide access to Adobe’s video-editing tools including exclusive effects, transitions, title presets and more tailored to YouTube Shorts. Related Stories 'Superman' Goes Serious: James Gunn’s DC Reboot Submits for Drama Categories at the Golden Globes (EXCLUSIVE) AMC Theatres Posts $298.2 Million Quarterly Loss Despite Summer Hits Like 'Superman,' 'Jurassic World Rebirth'
The Adobe Premiere app’s Creator for YouTube Shorts section will include a library ready-to-use templates (e.g., for day-in-the-life vlogs, travel videos and get-ready-with-me videos), and users also will be able to create their own templates and share them. Once they’re done creating a video, users can upload them to YouTube Shorts with a single tap. Popular on Variety
In addition, YouTube creators will be able to access Premiere mobile’s pro-level editing tools. The app provides AI-generated sound effects and Firefly-powered generative AI features, but those are available only with paid subscriptions. The Create for YouTube content creation space in Adobe Premiere mobile will be available directly from YouTube’s app by tapping on an “Edit in Adobe Premiere” icon that will appear in YouTube Shorts.
“With Premiere mobile, we want to let anybody be creator, with just a phone in their hand, and empower them to make amazing content,” said Mike Polner, Adobe’s VP of product marketing for creators. It was an obvious decision to partner with YouTube, he said: “Our two interests have really aligned about how we serve creators.”
YouTube’s own app includes an array of features for shooting and editing Shorts videos. Sarah Ali, VP of product management at YouTube, sees the partnership to integrate with Adobe Premiere mobile as “meeting creators where they are.”
“We know creators are already using Adobe for Shorts,” Ali said. The partnership is aimed at helping them to “unlock more stories.”
The new partnership will be featured in Tuesday’s kickoff to the 2025 Adobe MAX Creative Conference in L.A.
YouTube Shorts videos, which can be up to 3 minutes in length, have exploded in popularity since the TikTok-like format was introduced in 2020. YouTube Shorts has over 2 billion monthly users and more than 200 billion views daily, according to YouTube.
YouTube creator Cleo Abram (6.85 million subscribers), who produces “optimistic tech explainers,” told Variety that Premiere mobile has made it “easier and faster to bring our stories to life, even while we’re in the field.”
“Now, what I’m most excited to see from YouTube and Adobe’s new partnership is how even more creators will have access to the kind of pro-level editing and creative control that used to be locked behind expensive tools and distribution,” Abram said. “Not anymore. Adobe and YouTube are throwing open the door for a whole new wave of voices, perspectives and ideas to shine.”
Mai Pham , a beauty and lifestyle creator (with 3.5 million YouTube subscribers), said having Premiere mobile has been a “game-changer” in creating content especially at concerts, festivals and other events. “What excites me most about Adobe Premiere mobile is what it means for new aspiring creators who might feel intimidated by desktop editing,” Pham said. “Having Adobe’s tools accessible on mobile makes it so much easier to get started learning, and when you’re ready to level up, transitioning to the computer becomes so much less scary.”

The viewing platform for Emmy nominees opens on Aug. 13, with final-round voting, beginning on Aug. 19 at 9:00 am PT until Aug. 30 at 10:00 pm PT.
The Primetime Emmy Awards , better known as the Emmys , is given out by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS). Since 1949, the awards recognize excellence in American primetime television programming. They are divided into three classes – Primetime Emmy Awards, the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards (honors artisan achievements) and the Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards (recognizes significant engineering and technological contributions). The typical eligibility period is between June 1 and May 31 of any given year.
